&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How I Made My Holiday Cards NFTs, Kind Of —&amp;nbsp;And How You Can Get In On The Next Block&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before we begin, I want to make it clear that this isn’t a ‘genuine’ NFT, in many regards and for a few reasons. If anything, this is more of a traditional token (and it’s not even that) since the physical holiday cards themselves all have the same properties — they’re literally fungible. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no money being made here. In fact, the proof of work this cost me along with the total lack of utility means I’ll forever be in the red. But, this is an interesting project &amp;amp; one that gave me a much deeper understanding of blockchain. I hope it does the same for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’m going to go over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Why I did this —&amp;nbsp;and a brief history lesson &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How I did it —&amp;nbsp;and why this works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How to confirm your card if you’re a node. i.e., got my card in the mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Overview &amp;amp; Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I’ll address your initial questions: &amp;quot;what is this thing, Nick? I thought blockchains were on the web, or in the cloud, or.. everywhere! Not on a Christmas card!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be mostly correct, but not fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been involved in crypto since 2017 and the past year have been working as the Growth Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mimo.capital/&quot;&gt;Mimo&lt;/a&gt;, a stable coin issuance protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I started watching Gary Gensler’s MIT course on blockchain and money. While my mind was consistently blown, a particular section caught my attention. Gary asked the class what the longest running blockchain is. Naturally, murmurs of Bitcoin fill the air. But although Bitcoin solved somethings in a novel fashion and created a new application for the tech, the first blockchain was consistently running for more than a decade prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, this blockchain has been maintained since 1995 and a new ‘block’ is published every Sunday in the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nyt-hash.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, bear with me, because if you don’t understand crypto entirely yet, this will truly make things seen in a different, tangible light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand some quick fundamentals on blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a couple key components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hashes, nonces, and unique, immutable data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cryptocurrencies you’re probably using today, the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; piece are the transactions that take place in each block; while the hashes and nonces might even go unseen as we abstract ourselves away from the underlying tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you consider that this is all that is required to successfully maintain a blockchain, you realize tech itself, or computers, aren’t even necessary - though, makes it actually feasible, sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times is a pretty popular publication that gets distributed into many hands. These act as our confirmation nodes. The Times is also dated. Something that couldn’t really be forged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitalik Buterin even mentions how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1034014732984967175&quot;&gt;difficult it would be to break this chain&lt;/a&gt;. The same attack could be done if someone decided to forge my greeting cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How &amp;amp; Why This Works (through a distributed greeting card)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough history, here’s where we are now. Although I would’ve loved to build a chain from scratch, the tech debt became entirely unworthy. It’d not be unlike spending $100 in electricity to mine $0.50 of ETH. So, take some liberties with me and enjoy the ride no matter how unsecure it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piggyback off &lt;a href=&quot;https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain&quot;&gt;Anders Brownworth’s Blockchain 101 site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course we shouldn’t trust anyone, so I decided — in typical crypto fashion — to fork it. Even more on-brand, we hard forked it. This just means that I’m now maintaining this separately from the upcoming blocks on the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; chain. Of course in this example, it’s not a live, moving, chain, but the concepts are still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you can install your own instance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/blockchain-demo&quot;&gt;Nick Calabro Holiday Card Global Chain&lt;/a&gt;, Anders’ works as of right now so you can simply use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how’s it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s look at the components of the holiday card. We have the &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;, a hash, a URL, and - most importantly - a postage date. The date is what makes each and every block unique &amp;amp; verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of my cards, we assume their dates are Christmas day of that block’s year. Again, this is a brutally imperfect implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schema for how we display the block’s data is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 25, 2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;URL&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we imagine that date having to match an immutable postage date, we have a truly verifiable blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The URL is also a piece that an attacker would be needing a forge as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all we have to do is mine the first block, enter the data from the card onto a new block, and mine #2. If the created hash matches the one on the token, you’ve verified your holiday card is truly from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the vector for attack is ripe. There’s only 1 block so far. So, in theory, all one would have to do is send everyone cards with my face on it, make up their own data, and they can effectively hack the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 reasons why it’s still entirely easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years go on and I send more cards, the chain grows, and then the attacker would have to repeat the previous year’s cards to recreate the entire chain to match up with their current block’s hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years progress, you’ll have to install the chain’s history to catch up. And, as more years go on, more people are going to enter my network and start receiving holiday cards. These are all extra entities carrying a copy of the ledger since they’ll have that latest hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If almost everyone in my network decided to burn their cards, and an attacker tried overtaking the whole chain, so long as there’s 1 person with a card still on their fridge, that would disprove the new side-chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How To Confirm Your Holiday Card On-Chain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure you’re getting genuine holiday cards from me, the one and only, you can either trust me, or you can verify me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you trust the greeting card is from myself &amp;amp; truly authentic? Well, the incentive to fake a holiday card from me is quite low. These cards aren’t being traded and they’re really an ephemeral slice of cardboard that gets tossed by 95% of recipients anyway. Trust, in this case, is not a bug - nor even a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the spirit of overly-optimizing, let’s verify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Details &amp;amp; Schema&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To collect the data necessary to confirm the hash on your card, there are a couple things we’ll need to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;: an immutable timestamp that can never be recreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique id&lt;/strong&gt;: each block (holiday card) comes with an image. That URL is used to verify as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis Block&lt;/strong&gt;: The first block has already been mined and is ready to be built upon, the data in that block also helps make up the hash that you’re seeing on your card now. If you can’t confirm that first block, you’re already side-chaining and no further cards can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll know you have the correct Genesis Block when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;its previous hash is 64 0s&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;its data is simply: &lt;code&gt;nick.finance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;its nonce is: &lt;code&gt;4008&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;and its current hash after mining is &lt;code&gt;000094ad55d3f7eccb5a1c1d6f1d2c36f52d77ee47ca98a26371267cddb53bf0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Claiming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my investment philosophies is to buy things that you &lt;em&gt;want to own&lt;/em&gt;. This is how most die-hards get away with holding on to certain NFTs regardless of where they’re trading at. By accepting the card, you’ve &amp;quot;claimed your token&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: The Timestamp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the properties surrounding this entire chain is the concept of time. Since there’s only 1 moment of time that can never be changed, it’s a great function to use as it’ll be different every &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we were creating a truly secure chain, we’d already be broken, as the postal service is subject to human-error and may not stamp the card at the chain’s expected time. So for the purposes of the Nick Calabro Holiday Card Global Chain, we’re going to assume the date is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; December 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: The Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the components necessary to mine, we can go ahead and put it together to create the next block’s hash that is written on your card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;December 25, 2021
https://nick.finance/holiday-2021.png&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is block #2’s data. If we followed this patter, you could even guess next year’s, but that would be wildly insecure! So, know that although we’re not running this through any random number generators, the filename for the next block will not be &lt;code&gt;holiday-2022.png&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we discussed above, this is a hard fork from Anders Brownworth’s example that you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/blockchain&quot;&gt;on his website&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, you might be best off using his to confirm (for now) since you’ll be forced to install and run my fork locally. This aspect is even similar to the first days of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: As of writing this, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/blockchain-demo&quot;&gt;Nick Calabro Holiday Card Global Chain&lt;/a&gt;hard fork is not modified for prime-time. Tech debt..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Whether you’re using Anders’ or installed your own ledger locally, let’s mine the chain and confirm you have an authentic greeting card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the blockchain tab, you’ll find a series of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/block-1-unmined.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know the data for the genesis block: &lt;code&gt;nick.finance&lt;/code&gt;, and that’s all you need to input before hitting &lt;code&gt;mine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining the block will find the correct nonce to create our first hash. On the second block, gather your data and enter it. The previous block’s hash is pre-loaded for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/block-2-unmined.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice the block is still red, meaning it hasn’t been mined yet or simply broken. If the data is entered correctly, go ahead and mine the block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, block #2’s hash should match the card on your greeting card, thus giving you proper verification that this is truly from me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll know you won if your screen looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/confirmed-chain.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Known attack vectors &amp;amp; imperfections:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The timestamp. The postal service is run by humans. Humans are prone to error. Unlike the NYT example where the operation is smooth enough to ensure there’s always an issue being distributed on a particular day of the week, I don’t trust that we can be so specific with this case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, by creating the rule now, that the date of new blocks will be December 25, we can assume this will always be true —&amp;nbsp;until we hard-fork and change the whole thing again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Which Mode are You In | And How To Be Productive In It&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zd_aY6Pa328&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding and determining which mode you’re in can be the difference between getting a lot done with little energy and getting nothing done while using all your energy. Scheduling your day to optimize for context and your current mindset can greatly impact your effectiveness and time management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt;? As we briefly discuss in the difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Habits-vs-Tasks&quot;&gt;habits and tasks&lt;/a&gt;, your mode can be anything from &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The zone you’re currently in&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The store you’re currently shopping in&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The feeling you currently have &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The level of energy you’re currently working with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mode is very important because it determines how well you’re going to perform at any given task that you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Determine Your Mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wake up one day and have the urge to clean off your desk and do some organizing. Similarly, you may wake up another day and have a similar urge but to do some heavy programming on the new app you’re building. You also might have urges to make some sales calls or even write your holiday postcards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all natural modes that come to us without our consent. They’re just what we feel like doing and we’re going to usually do them. In addition to them being thrust upon us, they’re enforced by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Entities-and-Environments&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and what we were doing previously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is how unoptimized mode-management can harm you. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you started taking sales and admin calls at 9 am and at 11 am decide it’s time to switch gears it’s important to evaluate all the tasks at hand. Why’re you switching gears? We have a list of other calls to make and we’re already prepared to make them. We’re at the phone, we have our scripts and resources in front of us, and we’re in the mindset, or the &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt;, to get these calls completed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very obvious mode of &lt;em&gt;making sales and admin&lt;/em&gt; calls must be scheduled in the proper manner so that they all get done in the same window of time. The harm here is when you unknowingly take on another task that requires a &lt;strong&gt;switching cost&lt;/strong&gt; and time ends up being wasted — this is most prominent when after the switching cost is completed, one has to revert back to their previous task to fully accomplish it. If you’re following along, you can see that going back and forth between projects isn’t only ineffective &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;because multi-tasking makes you lose focus&lt;/a&gt;, but also because the time it takes to switch from one task to another builds up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, your mindfulness and awareness to create proper schedules are what will keep you most efficient regarding your modes and how you cultivate them to work for you instead of you working around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mode&lt;/em&gt; vs. Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may see the similarities between modes and contexts. After all, they’re essentially the same thing if we’re referring to things like &lt;em&gt;phone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;grocery shopping&lt;/em&gt;. However, while contexts overall properties of a task, your mode is the feeling you have to do that task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be in the grocery store and satisfy the &lt;em&gt;grocery store&lt;/em&gt; context but at the same time be in the mode of &lt;em&gt;sales calls&lt;/em&gt; if you were doing the prior. Sure, you’ll naturally migrate to the other mode once you find yourself shopping, but your mode isn’t something that relies on location like context does, your mode is simply what you ought to be doing because your body is telling you it’s going do that best at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each day, determining which modes you were in along with which contexts you executed in can help understand how you work most effectively. The most efficient system is the one that works for you and understanding your different modes and how to bring the best out of all of them will certainly help keep you up to date with your body and make you aware of your energy. &lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2017-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Life-With-Zero-Notifications</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Life With Zero Notifications&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGEe6bM4nKc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably consider yourself an organized person who is in control of your life. You may even say that your time is so valuable and that no one can make you do anything. If you have notifications enabled on your mobile device, the above statements are likely untrue. Any time a notification comes through your phone, you’re instantly taken away from any task you’re currently working on — you’re not only losing time from catering to the text, email, or whatever came through, you’re also using precious mental energy switching from one task to another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href=&quot;nickcalabro.com/deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;deep work&lt;/a&gt; comes from pure focus and knowing what you ought to be doing at any given moment. Once you’re in the proper &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt; and feel maximally productive with the proper amount of attention required for this task, you’re perfectly prepared for tackling the task and accomplishing the project. The only things that may get in your way are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasN4Y9jx7Y&quot;&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;digital life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is when someone’s at the door badgering you about paying your rent. Digital life is when someone’ texting you badgering you about something else. Both require your attention — or do they? If someone’s at the door, you can answer it — I have no problem with that. If someone’s texting you, they’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; at your door for a reason — their request is less severe — they don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; your attention straight away. Do you give it to them? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people say, yes, they give their attention to them even if their outreach was through text message or email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is merely poor time allocation and the inability to focus taking over. You know you should be working on something and you may even feel like you’re ready to take it on effectively; a text message is an excuse to procrastinate and not actually get any work done. The nature of communication should be instant — it can be when we’re referring to phone calls, door-knocking, and dinner dates. However, there’s no reason you should be working on your novel &lt;em&gt;along with&lt;/em&gt; actively contributing to three group chats and keeping up with minute-by-minute political stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Losing Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even bigger facet of this issue is that you’re giving up all your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You’re predictably responsive. This spoils people and gets them eager to text you at any given moment expecting a response straight away. &lt;strong&gt;They control when you answer them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You’re unable to accomplish your goals. If people are texting and emailing you whenever it’s convenient for them, you’re running on their schedule and living by their clock. The solution to this isn’t to stay up until 4 am so you can actually get some work done while everyone’s asleep — the solution is to determine your schedule and stick to it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You’re not happening — the world around you is happening. If you’re getting notifications about new bills being signed into law and latest celebrity deaths it’s going to impact your performance for no reason. This is easily solved by setting aside thirty minutes at the end of the day to review all the deaths, emails, and other news you wish to be caught up on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control is one thing most humans desire. It’s the freedom to do what you want when you want, and however much of it you want. The only thing stopping you from getting to a level of freedom is you. You are the most important person and you shall not allow notifications to dictate when you do something — it’s not the path to success and certainly not the path to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably notice that when you’re in certain buildings, rooms, or overall environments you feel more energized and productive than others. You might notice that when trying to accomplish certain tasks at home vs. the office it’s much more difficult for you to focus. Similarly, you may find that getting certain tasks done on your touchscreen devices is impossible compared to, say, a computer. Where you’re trying to get work done and through which means greatly impacts the level of productivity you’ll get to work with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Different Devices for Different Duties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people refer to their iPad or tablet as their &lt;em&gt;consumption device&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use it nearly exclusively for reading news, watching movies, or browsing the web. More often than not, if they’re so exclusively reading books on their tablets and then try to pick up where they left off on in the story on their computer, they’ll feel out of place and experience trouble focusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have multiple assistants all aggregating and organizing the relative papers and tasks, slams them in front of you on your desk, you handle them all, put it all away, and the next assistant comes along to do the same thing for a different topic. This is essentially what is happening when you condition yourself to understand one device for one activity. Each device is that assistant laying out the relevant things for you to take care of right then and there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some practical examples of this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An iPad with only iBooks, your favorite RSS reader, and a web browser.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You better believe that you are only going to be reading and consuming the news on this iPad. Even before you take any action, simply seeing the only available applications prepares you for doing nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An AppleScript that opens a browser, text editor, and Terminal.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, you’re stuck on the computer which is probably your main workstation that has &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Unless you have multiple computers you can devote for certain activities, creating workflows that place the relevant items in front of you can nearly act as that personal assistant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For doing your web development or programming, a script that opens the tools needed in a separate &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt; for that is just enough to clear your mind of anything else and focus on the tasks at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An iPhone with social media apps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be a marketing manager who has to post to Pinterest and Twitter every hour on the hour. Note to yourself to unlock your phone, navigate to a page with the relevant apps placed in order of which to post on first, and you’re good to go. Most of the friction is removed and your only job is to post, not to remember everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where You Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that you’re in a completely different mindset if you’re in the coffee shop than when you’re in the office — even compared to when you’re home but on the couch vs. the desk vs. the bed? Unless you have enough tunnel-vision to completely block out where you are at all times, your environment is going to impact what you’ll feel like working on and how well you’ll perform working on that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard Business Review has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-you-can-focus-in-a-coffee-shop-but-not-in-your-open-office&quot;&gt;great write-up&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of why you’re more focused while in a coffee shop than in the office. The issue goes deeper than just where you are but who’s around you as well. In this situation, knowing that there are people you directly work with who can easily distract you by speaking about things you’re currently working with other co-workers is, by itself, distracting. On top of that, anyone discussing anything along with the knowledge that anyone can look over your shoulder is just as distracting. This is a large debate in the tech community nowadays regarding open offices and such but slightly deviates from the scope of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cultivate Your Climate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to take more advantage of your inevitable shifts in productivity based on location is to allocate certain tasks to certain areas. If you’re working on the same laptop all day for all your tasks, you can essentially have multiple workstations with just one device depending on how well you organize your spaces, programs, and environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this by contextualizing the different tasks you have to get done to certain areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Desk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Couch&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Coffee shop&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Library&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Patio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have three different workplaces doing work for us by getting us in a certain mindset all with one device. Know how you operate and allocate certain tasks that you’ll accomplish more effectively in whichever context. Something that requires focus might be done best in the library or at your desk whereas something that is more lighthearted can be done in bed since you’re likely going to be in a comfortable position — finally something monotonous like checking email or organizing your task manager could be done on your couch or patio since the ambiance can’t really interfere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best system is always the one that works best for you. If you find that you can only focus on an important task at certain times of day in certain locations, don’t pass up an opportunity to trick your mind into getting you in that place so you can focus and accomplish those tasks. Sometimes getting up and moving someplace else is the most important push your body needs to finally be in the proper mindset to get things done. Ultimately, sounds, locations, and ambiance can drastically impact how much you get done and how effectively you do it — be in control of how well and how timely you do things by becoming more aware of your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>No Place to Hide: Book Review</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;No Place to Hide: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLfvA6lGT8I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenn Greenwald’s &lt;em&gt; No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first books I read that wasn’t about startups or marketing. While the surveillance issues were in the news constantly, Snowden being mentioned every day, and even the Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning débâcle, the text was extremely relevant and a must-read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/noplaceto.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The story of how Glenn Greenwald initially got in contact with Edward Snowden and what happened after they met. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The leak — scans of all the documents that prove everyone is being watched.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What it means. Some psychological nuances that are a result of everything covered so far. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Snowden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Snowden and Greenwald meeting was very enthralling. It played out like a Bond movie and kept me eager to learn more and what will come about from their relationship. Snowden initially contacted him through PGP which is an encryption tool used for passing data and messages securely that can’t be read by anyone without the key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily, Greenwald had never used tools or services like this so he missed the opportunity to speak with Snowden at first and had to hop through a few hoops to finally get the chance to open a dialogue. Inspired by this, you’ll notice many people’s personal websites and Twitter bios contain their &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; along with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pgp.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT database&lt;/a&gt; of searchable public keys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Greenwald ventures overseas to meet Snowden along with a crew including Laura Poitras who directed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/&quot;&gt;Citizenfour&lt;/a&gt; about the same encounter. Greenwald is illuminated by Snowden’s story and slowly and meticulously leaks more and more data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Being Watched Means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenwald does a great job of explaining the impact of what it means for the average person if they’re being watched. Things like the Hawthorne Effect prove it impacts people even if they’re not always thinking they’re being watched. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It raises the question that’s also addressed in the text along with numerous blog posts found on the web that most of the public doesn’t even care they’re being surveilled because they have nothing to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the government listen in on my phone calls. I’m only talking to my grandmother about dinner plans for the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even care if anyone’s reading my texts. I’m not plotting any attacks so they won’t even bother me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the better arguments against this process is if you imagine your home without curtains. You wouldn’t feel comfortable having big open windows into your home, nor would you feel comfortable removing the door form the restroom. We know what goes on in the restroom, everyone does, but that doesn’t mean we want anyone watching us do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only bad people wish to have a slice of privacy. The thesis here is just because you may have nothing to hide doesn’t mean you would be okay with giving up all your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: 1984&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Orwell’s &lt;em&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/em&gt; depicts many of these themes and is extremely prominent in Greenwald’s writing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1904006123251024&amp;amp;set=a.1727792874205684.1073741831.100009249655883&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;The Broadway performance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; that recently closed demonstrates perfectly well the ignorance you may endure while being watched — even better than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/&quot;&gt;1984 movie&lt;/a&gt; starring John Hurt since the live-action played with your emotions more personally. I recommend all versions and mediums of Orwell’s writing to get a deeper understanding and more natural display of how being watched can modify behavior and impact anyone psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Budget Your Time&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GasN4Y9jx7Y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If time is money, why don’t we treat it similarly? You may be a frugal budgeter who finds joy in getting something at half off. However, you may also spend frivolously for a special occasion and treat yourself to some high-end dining and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d never spend money on something that provided no value to you — or that didn’t help you grow at all — nor generated any entertainment for you. If you wouldn’t throw money at things like this, why do we throw time at things like this? We don’t even realize we’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money is a more quantifiable entity than time. If you’re holding a dollar bill in your hand, a minute later it’s still there — that minute is gone forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How’re You Spending Your Time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear people whine all the time about how they got nothing done the day before and just ate ice cream and binged on TV shows for hours on end. It’s almost as if they had no control over their bodies and were forced to complete an entire season of the latest reality show. This person let the lure of the mindless entertainment happen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You rarely wake up and say to yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to sit on the couch and throw the entire day away watching home shopping networks and browse social media all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are saying this to yourself you may need to reevaluate your goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wake up and say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to go for a jog, freshen up, and work on this side-project I’ve been meaning to get to for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say this to yourself — good, you’re motivated; but are you productive? Saying this to yourself is great, but taking action on it is your trouble. Don’t just hope these things will get done without planning for it. You don’t hope you won’t spend all your money; you budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spending Your Time on a Budget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you assess what has to get done for the day: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Write it out&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-be-productive-and-get-my-agenda-for-the-day-accomplished-quickly/answer/Nick-Calabro-1&quot;&gt;Compartmentalize&lt;/a&gt; what should get done when and where&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Determine how long each task will take&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;Schedule it&lt;/a&gt; (along with TV binging time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re following along you may realize this is exactly how you may budget your finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kicker using this method — besides putting everything in a scheduled and structured system assuring they’ll all get done — is that you can actually binge TV and surf the web aimlessly. You have the right to &lt;em&gt;waste&lt;/em&gt; time as long as you’re &lt;em&gt;wasting&lt;/em&gt; it in the slots that you’re comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll feel so much better spending three hours watching movies if you knew that you planned ahead for it in the beginning of the day and that you can afford to spend that time watching a movie than if you just let the movie happen to you without planning for it in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re budgeting time, you don’t completely cut out all the little (reasonable) luxuries like going out to eat every so often or attending the theatre. However, when you know you can allocate $100 that month to some frivolous activity because you planned for it, it’s okay. Tracking the money is the most important part and allows you to keep your finances up to date and in order. Tracking your time the same way allows you to not waste it and assures nothing falls through the cracks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to understand is that you don’t have to spend 100% of your time working and grinding. You also shouldn’t spend 100% of a day’s time performing mindless and numbing activities either. And the way to force yourself to be sure you keep a healthy balance of the two is by setting aside the appropriate amount of time for everything. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Custom ErgoDox iOS Keyboard</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/ErgoDox-iOS"/>
   <updated>2017-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/ErgoDox-iOS</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Custom ErgoDox iOS Keyboard&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ErgoDox Ergonomic Keyboard is unlike many keyboards you may be used to. Between its durable and customizable build, programmatic ability, and split personality, it truly has so much to offer any and all typists. The most intriguing feature of the keyboard is the layout. Setting aside all the things that make it great, the ErgoDox can still be considered a novel input device with the layout alone. Allowing for extra keys to be hit where they’re most convenient and the ortholinear nature of it makes for one of the greatest typing experiences ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the unique keyboard relies on human hands resting on its paw-shaped imprint, it’d be fun to have a similar style on our mobile devices. Sure, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-flow-keyboard-english/id1077864246?mt=8&quot;&gt;specially shaped keyboard apps for iOS that optimize for your fingers&lt;/a&gt;, but none that are simply a fun homage to a mechanical keyboard enthusiast favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple first announced they were allowing third-party keyboards, I was one of the first to hop on board. It was easily my favorite update to iOS that year. People were daunted when they realized the process of building a keyboard was extensive and that there was little provided by Apple to get started. What’s required is essentially building an entire keyboard from scratch, and then whatever special functionality you want on top of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Open Xcode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you create a new project, head right over to File &amp;gt; New &amp;gt; Target… and choose &lt;em&gt;Custom Keyboard Extension&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/targetdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to make sure the &lt;em&gt;Product Name&lt;/em&gt; is different than the currently encompassing project name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/nametargetdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re asked to active the scheme simply allow it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple defines a target as a &lt;em&gt;product to build&lt;/em&gt; that must be contained within an application. This structure is why content blockers, keyboards, and iMessage apps have to be within an app even if it hardly ever gets opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now add a Storyboard file using &lt;code&gt;CMD+N&lt;/code&gt;, scrolling to &lt;em&gt;User Interface&lt;/em&gt; and choosing the Storyboard option. Name it something unique like &lt;em&gt;DoxStoryboard&lt;/em&gt;, and create. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump to the target’s &lt;code&gt;info.plist&lt;/code&gt; file and under &lt;code&gt;NSExtension&lt;/code&gt;, remove the &lt;code&gt;NSExtensionPrincipalClass&lt;/code&gt; key. Add a new key under &lt;code&gt;NSExtension&lt;/code&gt; titled &lt;code&gt;NSExtensionMainStoryboard&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;DoxStoryboard&lt;/code&gt; or whatever you named the Storyboard file we created above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your &lt;code&gt;DoxStoryboard.storyboard&lt;/code&gt; and drag a &lt;em&gt;View Controller&lt;/em&gt; element on the canvas. Since we’re working with storyboards instead of xibs, it may take the shape of an iPhone sized rectangle. With the view controller selected, navigate to the &lt;em&gt;Size Inspector&lt;/em&gt;, change the &lt;em&gt;Simulated Size&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Freeform&lt;/em&gt; and modify the height and width. I have mine at 375x375. In the &lt;em&gt;Attributes Inspector&lt;/em&gt; be sure to select &lt;code&gt;Is Initial View Controller&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/emptystoryboarddox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we can go ahead and run our application. When navigating to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; Keyboards &amp;gt; Add New Keyboard… we’ll see our custom board ready to be added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/addnewkeydox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/selectkeydox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate more clearly your keyboard in use after enabling it, changing the background color of the storyboard to something garish can assist with providing some instant gratification. Linking the &lt;code&gt;KeyboardViewController&lt;/code&gt; class to the view controller will also provide some free functionality with the &lt;em&gt;Next Keyboard&lt;/em&gt; button as you can see here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/keydoxinuse.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: I’ve come across some issues while doing something similar with xibs instead of storyboards and had to add the &lt;code&gt;.storyboard&lt;/code&gt; file to the Target Membership like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/targetmembdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have everything connected, up, and running we can enjoy the fun part. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com/configurator/ergodox&quot;&gt;ErgoDox Layout&lt;/a&gt;, we can see there’s some unique placement, slightly staggering, and many sizes and orientations to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/emptdoxlayout.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever played with views and buttons inside Xcode’s Storyboards you’ll enjoy this because that’s just what needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/redbuttonsdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve monotonously and meticulously placed each key in its proper location, there’s some rotation magic that has to be done in code to get our &lt;em&gt;thumb&lt;/em&gt; buttons to act correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/clusterviewdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each thumb cluster should be in it’s own square-shaped view. Here, we’ll call them &lt;code&gt;leftThumbView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rightThumbView&lt;/code&gt;. Connect those outlets, be sure these buttons are on top of the view, and configure the view with something along the lines of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.leftThumbView.transform = self.leftThumbView.transform.rotated(by: CGFloat(M_PI_2/2))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will get the cluster to rotate as soon as the keyboard loads to give the the effect of the lovely hand-shaped keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/outlineviewdox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to make the storyboard less jarring, I’ve decided to hew to a certain color scheme. The keyboard community loves creating themed keycap sets and running exclusive &lt;em&gt;group buys&lt;/em&gt; so you feel forced to get in on everything before they’re coveted only a few months later. A classic example of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://originative.co/products/hyperfuse&quot;&gt;HyperFuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful and crisp GMK colors made any keyboard look amazing, especially an ErgoDox. In fact — it’s so lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/Hyperfuse&quot;&gt;I even made an Xcode theme in honor of it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;img/hyperdox.png&quot;/&gt; I figured to hew to the same cool and calm colors for the duration of the keyboard creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Typing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the layout is out of the way we have to get to some actual functionality. There are many ways to go about programming the keyboard and getting the input/output to perform as expected. A popular method is to read whatever the label of the key is and spit that out. Although this is quick and dirty, when we have such a customizable keyboard like this it’s pretty hard to hardcode such generic functionality. We’ll go with this approach for some of the keyboard like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/completeicondox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having the glyph as the button’s text, we can extract that and have that input with some simple actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@IBAction func actuation(sender: UIButton!) {
        let typedChar = sender.titleLabel?.text
        let proxy = textDocumentProxy as UITextDocumentProxy
        proxy.insertText(typedChar!)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect this action to most of your keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space bar is much simpler to implement since we only need to insert a nearly empty string &amp;quot; &amp;quot;. Be sure to connect this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@IBAction func spaceActuate() {
        let proxy = textDocumentProxy as UITextDocumentProxy
        proxy.insertText(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the power of the ErgoDox is essentially unlimited, the powers of the third-party keyboard tools Apple provides are not unlimited. There are some &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interesting things we can do with this, but we’ll cover only the essentials for now and get to deleting and navigating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has done a swell job of making the basics of keyboard creating fairly simple. The next methods used to delete, hide the keyboard, and navigate the insertion point are self-explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@IBAction func hideBoard() {
        dismissKeyboard()
}
    
@IBAction func delete() {
        let proxy = textDocumentProxy as UITextDocumentProxy
        proxy.deleteBackward()
}
    
@IBAction func moveRight() {
        let proxy = textDocumentProxy as UITextDocumentProxy
        proxy.adjustTextPosition(byCharacterOffset: 1)
}
    
@IBAction func moveLeft() {
        let proxy = textDocumentProxy as UITextDocumentProxy
        proxy.adjustTextPosition(byCharacterOffset: -1)
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/erg.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Real Ergo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/mydox.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done. Our ErgoDox for iOS is in a fine place and now it’s time to get to real keyboards. You can view my real &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/ErgodoxLayout&quot;&gt;programmable ErgoDox layout here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/ErgoDoxiOS&quot;&gt;I’ve uploaded the project here&lt;/a&gt;. Programming input peripherals whether virtual or physical is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few ErgoDoxes and glad I was able to bring the novelty of it to mobile devices while learning about Apple’s fun new SDKs. There’re a lot of places this custom keyboard can go and I’m eager to try more things with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/23pkN4N8CKg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport, the same author that brought us &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, makes us look at our work and life habits differently again with his previously published book, &lt;em&gt; So Good They Can&amp;#39;t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/sogood.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text begins with jarringly pessimistic ideas explaining how passion is rare and you should never follow your passion. Discussing the concept shines a light on the true ignorance of the notion — if you have a passion for shoelaces, should you follow your passion, quit your job, and spend 12 hours a day researching and manufacturing shoelaces? Sure, you might be the shoelace pundit of the planet, but it’s also not practical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newport explains how following your passion is the worst advice you could receive because it creates this fantasy in your mind that you should be doing whatever you feel most comfortable doing and that you should quit ten jobs until you find one that you’re truly &lt;em&gt;passionate&lt;/em&gt; about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t do what you love — learn to love what you do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare that you’ll find someone that is truly passionate about their job. It may seem that they’re passionate if they love what they do, though. By accepting your role, mastering it, and being so good you can’t be ignored, you’ll surely become passionate about the field just because you’re so invaluable on the subject. Mastering something creates passion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Always Bring Value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you’re doing, you can bring value. If you’re given a task that seems daunting but know that you can excel and improve the project in another way while still somewhat solving the original issue, do that. No matter how wide or narrow your scope of the overall project is, there is some fault that only you may spot and know how to solve. Create your own mini-objectives and solve fabricated puzzles created by yourself if it means wrapping up a project for the greater good of the product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ~ Howard Thurman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more specialized your skillset the better job you may be able to acquire. If you’re an expert on one of the most esoteric programming languages known to man and come across an ancient firm that has been running on a codebase like that for decades, you’ll have all the power in the world to create the job you want. If the job isn’t something you’d prefer, create a &amp;quot;side-mission&amp;quot; for yourself to get motivated. Understanding the goals of the company is one thing, but if that doesn’t arouse you either, something more granular and personal will have to do to get you performing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adjacent Possible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newport describes, as do many other texts and philosophies, the Adjacent Possible. This is the area that you should strive for to break the most boundaries and to leave the biggest of possible marks you can leave. Possibles will display themselves as you acquire rare and valuable skills and they’ll be more exposed the harder you work to advance intelligence further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities like this aren’t popping up once a week — they may only come up once a decade. Your career capital is the most important currency you can acquire and cultivate and that is what is going to get you better jobs, more prestigious connections, and ultimately will provide for a bigger adjacent possible. Career capital is built up over a career of multiple jobs, roles, expertise, and such. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between loving what you do, doing what you love, building your resume with impressive projects and passion projects, you’re always gaining expertise, career capital, and fixing toward an adjacent possible. This is the key to being so good they can’t ignore you. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Steps to Achieving Inbox Zero</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;5 Steps to Achieving Inbox Zero&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cGfjBe-gPU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more than twenty emails in your inbox right now you may need to research methods on how to manage your email. Inbox Zero is a way of life that promotes a clean and empty email inbox at all times. Once you check your email, you clean it immediately. Create todo items, scribble in reference items, or reply to people in touch with you as soon as you see an email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started isn’t easy and can be a daunting task. These 5 steps will help break down the process and hopefully mitigate the torture of making big changes to your chaotic inbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Get the right email app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Importance-of-Inbox-Zero&quot;&gt;Inbox Zero is a methodology&lt;/a&gt; that can technically be used with any software but that doesn’t mean it isn’t easier and encouraged by certain apps and services. Basic email apps like Gmail, ’s standard Mail.app, and other generic email clients are some of the most bare-boned ways to manage email. Some people may like the lack of fluff — or in Apple’s case, the addition of their machine learning and sketching features. Ugly and primitive email clients can be great for staying focused on what really matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email clients that encourage Inbox Zero make it very obvious and are difficult to use any other way. Apps like Airmail, Inbox by Gmail, and Outlook all have distinct features that make you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have an empty inbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniences like snoozing email to a later date, bundling promos and updates into folders automatically, and displaying animations when you reach Inbox Zero are great ways to accomplish effectively managed email. More features like these means less you have to manage yourself. Being reminded about an email you send out a month later if there’s no response is surely a job the email client can handle without you cluttering your todo list with outreach tasks like that. Although they’re not essential, they’re great to have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Create folders &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t keep all your documents, photos, programs, and links on your desktop — I hope you don’t. You probably have a documents directory with subdirectories and even folders inside that to categorize your Photoshop files along with your wedding photos and all separated from your essays you need for school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing email as files is a great way to think of how to store them when they act as reference items or reminders. Creating folders in your email client for things like &amp;quot;waiting&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;reference&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;family vacation&amp;quot; bring so much value to your workflow. Search functionality in email clients are great nowadays but there’s no better feeling than opening up your email client, navigating to a folder, and instantly finding the confirmation number for the musical tickets you’re bringing a friend to while waiting on line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Archive everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most action you’re ever going to take regarding your email is when you finally decide to archive everything. If you’re like most people, you keep hundreds of emails in your inbox and &amp;quot;mark as read&amp;quot; the ones you want to forget about without actually allocating them someplace or deleting them. This probably means you have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of emails all in one place and always in your face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archiving is the safest thing you can do with an email. Nothing is getting deleted and everything is still searchable. You’re merely getting it out of your face and not being bothered with it until that one time every few years you find yourself making obscure search queries to find an old email again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended method of going about this is simply selecting all and archiving it. You’ll feel better, sleep better, and live longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Hew to the Inbox Zero mindset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that your environment is built you have to modify some behavior to maintain it. I never leave people with a beautiful system just to ditch them and have them mess it up a week later. There’s a mindset that has to be learned and adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short - understand the Inbox Zero workflow by checking your email at certain and scheduled times of the day, taking action on all emails immediately whether you’re replying on the spot, deferring it to a later date, archiving it on the spot, or creating action items based on it that you have to take care of later. Your inbox is for getting mail, not storing nor prioritizing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Use your trusted system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective way of managing your email is to not manage it at all. If you have a trusted task manager all your email can flow directly into it. Any new mail can act as an action item — &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; has to be done with this; it may be as simple as recording it in the journal or as complicated as writing a four-page proposal for a new customer. No matter what has to be done with it, it’s better if it’s managed in your trusted system than in your inbox. If your inbox &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your only trusted system, that calls for some further thought and action into your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is the best and worst thing in the world. Inbox Zero makes it slightly less terrible. Taking action on these steps and learning the ways of a well-managed and effective email will make you a more productive and happier person. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making it All Work | Book Review</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Making it All Work | Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPA90wOPJuU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Allen’s &lt;em&gt;Making it All Work: Winning at the Game of Work and the Business of Life&lt;/em&gt; is the ultimate supplement to his most popular work, &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;. While he teaches and instructs us how to actually get things done, in his other texts, this one takes a step back and forces us to look at the bigger picture. We’re not granularly checking off tasks anymore - we’re building a working and reliable system that’ll last an entire lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Game of Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work, life, and success are simply games - you just have to know how to play it. Accomplishing your tasks and being productive are not always easy. You may even look at some people who accomplish many things and ask yourself how you can be that proactive. The secret is to understand it as a game and figure out the best ways to win. &lt;em&gt;Hack&lt;/em&gt; it if you have to. Fool your mind into thinking you’re enjoying something you actually aren’t just so it gets done faster and more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/makingit.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little tips like choosing to do the most daunting and complicated task first thing in the morning is a big trick that can help you win. You’re smart enough to know yourself and how you may prefer to defer a certain task so by putting it in front of you as soon as you sit at the desk once you enter the office without the opportunity to even see anything else is merely falling into your own trap and for your own good. Perhaps creating arbitrary due dates for tasks that are open-ended but need to get done sometime is another way of trapping yourself into doing something. If you see it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be done by this week, you’ll just take care of it next week — the problem is that once next week comes around you’ll fall back into your deferment cycle. Something as simple as a due date next to the item on your task manager can put just enough pressure on you to get the task done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text talks a great deal about distractions and setting priorities as well. As we talked about from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;Cal Newport’s Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, notifications and email are some of the leading causes of slacking. The text paints painfully true pictures of how we’ll drop the most important thing for a measly email because the excitement and anticipation force you to learn whether it’s spam, a coupon, or even a job offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior like this leads to employees working extra long hours and even taking their work home with them. It’s a self-sabotaging prophecy when you wish to build a business on the side because you hate your day job but spend too much time dreaming about your side-business during working hours that you’re forced to do some work in the evening preventing you from accomplishing your true dreams. Another cycle that you put yourself through just because you’re losing focus on the bigger picture and neglecting to fool yourself into being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perspective + Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text does a great job of forcing you to desire both perspective and control in everything that you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspective&lt;/strong&gt; is the ability to see the big picture. Where do you want to be in five, ten, thirty years? What are the chapters that are going to enable you to accomplish the projects you wish to achieve? How long and how much energy is going to be needed to get from point A to point B?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control&lt;/strong&gt; is the ability to organize everything in the framework of those big pictures. If you’re working two jobs, parenting, and starting a business, define what each of those projects requires of you. Write down what your responsibilities are for each facet of your life and consistently review them so nothing falls through the cracks and you don’t end up scheduling a meeting with a client for your side-business while you’re supposed to be giving a presentation at work or picking up the kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of one of these things may make you sufficient when you’re striving to be proficient. Think of the difference between the editor and the novelist. One of them goes on book tours and gets book deals while the other reads tens of texts a week to makes edits here and there. Both are fine professions and happiness can be found in either. The &lt;strong&gt;novelist&lt;/strong&gt; is required to sit down, plan an entire book, write chapters, paragraphs, and maybe even footnotes. The &lt;strong&gt;editor&lt;/strong&gt; is required to look at the book at a much more granular level and doesn’t need the higher level view of the entire story sometimes. One of these roles requires perspective and control while the other requires only control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Business of Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BT2IOwJgUCd/?taken-by=nickcalabro&quot;&gt;life as a business &amp;amp; you’re the CEO&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re building a business you have to manage your executive staff, possibly investors, developers, and so much more — your life entails the same management. There’s no reason why the lifetime of your business should be planned out for the next five years with monthly and quarterly goals but your life shouldn’t. Building a business plan for your life is essential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your life can have the same kind of management as your business is one step. Understanding your life can be managed and backed up by software is the next. Dumping your ideas, thoughts, aspirations, and goals into your notebook so nothing falls through the cracks will ensure you’re able to properly assess and take action on your hopes and dreams. We learned a lot of this from &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt; but now relate it to the bigger picture of life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making decisions becomes easier once this is all implemented as well. You should have no trouble deciding something if you have your life’s business plan completed. It’s as simple as asking yourself, &amp;quot;does this get us closer to where we want to be by the end of the period?&amp;quot; — if not, the decision is made for you. There’s no guesswork once you’ve already concluded what is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is merely creating the path for yourself. If you’re driving across the country for the first time and have no idea where to go, getting there the first time is going to be the hardest. You have to keep in mind all the forks in the roads, the landmarks, the busy streets, and such. Only that first time will be challenging. The rest of the trip won’t be as meandering because then it’s just a question of driving rather than driving &lt;em&gt;and figuring out where to go&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making it All Work&lt;/em&gt; is, in some regards, better than &lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not as definitive but adds so much value in regard to why we’re even trying to get things done in the first place. Create a system, trust the system, and utilize the system is making it work for your enjoyment and your dreams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Read the Last Page First&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtBy_8pZVH4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Reiner’s classic, &lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt; kicked off 90s romantic comedies along with providing some insightful and debatable dialogue by Nora Ephron. The banter between Harry and Sally includes many facets of romantic relationships, platonic relationships, life itself, and some great humor. During their initial road trip after they meet for the first time, Harry suggests he has a dark side because he reads the last page of books first in case he dies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/harryreading.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I buy a new book, I read the last page first. That way, in case I die before I finish, I know how it ends. That, my friend, is a dark side. ~ Harry Burns, &lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to interpret this eccentric but valuable tip. On one hand, Billy Crystal’s character is thinking ahead and being responsible even if it is at the cost of being exceptionally morbid. On the other hand, it can be taken differently and more productively as if the lesson has an ulterior motive that revolves around a bigger picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Responsibly Reading the Last Page First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting and unconventional mindset that many people surely disagree with. Spoiling the story and reading ahead of a book just to learn about it in case you die. Dying in the process of reading a book is certainly possible — but not likely. That truly is a dark side when you consider your own death every time you open up a book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of knowing how the story ends before even beginning it might seem sacrilegious to some. Harry doesn’t seem to invest a lot of his emotions in the stories &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; so perhaps being comfortable while reading is more valuable than being shocked at plot twists and jump scares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His self-awareness is trumping his desire for entertainment and that’s a treasured attitude to have toward any act. Understanding where the book is going before it even sets the stage to open up for guessing where it might take you makes for a completely different experience. Similarly, that can be applied to how you manage your life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/harrysallycar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Productively Reading the Last Page First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Plan-Your-Wedding&quot;&gt;we briefly discussed&lt;/a&gt;, knowing where you’re headed is instrumental to getting there correctly. Once you have the end-goal in mind, everything you do will be working toward achieving that end-goal. In addition to simply setting the goal and envisioning where you might be in one month, one year, and even one decade, it’s crucial to properly plan for that. Creating a schedule, breaking big projects down, and looking at your goals more granularly is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the current year is a book and you pick it up to read the last page what does it say? It’s not easy to realistically predict where you might be by the end of the year and especially by the end of your life. Picking up the same book at the scope of a lifetime can allow for some of the best planning you’ll ever accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be small and gratifying successes here and there and that is merely life. To live that way forever is sufficient but nebulous — it relies on luck for bigger success since the smaller successes aren’t interlinked. A slapdash system is easily and habitually avoidable by reading the last page first and unconsciously letting your actions take you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/sallycar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what success looks like — all that is left is to execute it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_os3mAZZju0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you realize it or not, you’re full of habits that you hew to every single day. Your morning routine, bedtime ritual, and news consumption while commuting may all play out exactly the same each day. When something is so natural and comfortable it doesn’t need to be recorded and managed in your trusted system because &lt;em&gt;you are&lt;/em&gt; the trusted system. Understanding how your mind and body separates habits with things you may categorize as tasks is important for your productivity and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hab&lt;/strong&gt;·it&lt;br/&gt;noun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. an&amp;nbsp;acquired&amp;nbsp;behavior&amp;nbsp;pattern&amp;nbsp;regularly&amp;nbsp;followed&amp;nbsp;until&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;become almost&amp;nbsp;involuntary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of a habit is your morning ritual. You’ll wake up and involuntarily hop out of bed, make the bed, brush your teeth, and do the rest of the things that you do every morning. The habit is so recurring that it has taken your body over and handles all the thinking and execution for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;task&lt;/strong&gt;, tahsk&lt;br/&gt;noun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. a&amp;nbsp;definite&amp;nbsp;piece&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;work&amp;nbsp;assigned&amp;nbsp;to,&amp;nbsp;falling&amp;nbsp;to,&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;expected&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;a person;&amp;nbsp;duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/What-is-a-Task&quot;&gt;we’ve discussed&lt;/a&gt;, a task is a single action that has to get done. Your morning ritual habit is technically comprised of multiple tasks. Breaking it down we can find a handful of specific items that have clear outcomes — but we don’t understand our habits as multiple tasks; they’re merely one big conglomerate known as, &amp;quot;the morning ritual&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evolution: Task &amp;#8680; Habit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will come a point when you get so involved with your trusted task manager that you record everything that has to get done. You may find yourself scheduling and setting deadlines for things like sleeping, eating dinner, and commuting. It’s okay to keep track of all the things you’re doing and going to do but when there’s a more efficient and effective method it’s your duty to optimize the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you notice things are going into the task manager grouped together and always at the same time and/or place, it may be a sign to form a habit. It’s redundant and time-consuming to check off, &amp;quot;shred documents before leaving the office&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;brush teeth before bed&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;ever single day&lt;/em&gt;. Managing the actual task of shredding and brushing your teeth is going to accumulate to a significant chunk of time that could’ve been avoided if you formed habits that took care of these things on auto-pilot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different from a recurring task like, &amp;quot;add hours and email invoice&amp;quot; that has to be done every 14 days. No one is expected to habitually take care of something that infrequent and so easily forgettable. However, some habits for me may be definite daily or weekly reminders for you. Many people need a bound weekly task that forces them to review their task manager when I take care of that completely on my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Single-Step &amp;amp; Multi-Faceted Habits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all tasks are created equal — as we’ve discussed, many times &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Projects-vs-Actions&quot;&gt;a task will turn into a project&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a problem and in fact easier to understand, if slightly more difficult to maintain, than if we weren’t looking at a project. Although projects look more complex, they’re easier to execute because of the well-defined steps. This translates well to habits because there are almost always multiple steps that have to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habitual projects are summed up as routines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Arrive at the office&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Greet Debbie, the secretary&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Start brewing your fancy imported coffee&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Check the office bulletin for any new updates&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fire up your computer and email&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Begin the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easily a 5 - 20-minute process was all understood and executed without a single reference to the task manager. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;em&gt;checking email&lt;/em&gt; isn’t included in the systematized project. Checking your email and inevitably responding to and creating action items for emails is a genuine task by itself and may require a scheduled block of time. Although maintaining email &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like a habit and may very well be, the time it takes is too variable to rely on. Even habits that are so significant should be managed unless you want to find yourself at lunchtime asking where the day went, how you missed that 11 am-deadline, and why you’re still responding to email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habits that last longer than 20-40 minutes aren’t habits; they’re unmanaged blocks of tasks that rely on your mind going into auto-pilot. It may sound luxurious to be free of thought for half the day while you’re taking care of some of these tasks, but this is exactly how things fall through the cracks &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commuting&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, requires you to be in &lt;em&gt;commute mode&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re driving to the office you’re in &lt;em&gt;driving to work mode&lt;/em&gt;, more specifically. You don’t understand your commute as a set of different turn-by-turn instructions — each as its own unique task on your task manager. You understand it as one habitual drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be situations where there are so many things that have to be done a habit is just impossible. If your morning routine lasts two hours and involves communicating with people, obtaining certain items, and more, a checklist may be in order. It’s going to be an interesting divide between habits, checklists, projects, and actions, but there’s no one-size-fits-all solution and every person will require unique methodologies. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Importance of the Inbox</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;The Importance of the Inbox&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HmCJ6BupW8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any given time during any given day we’re certain to come across objects, ideas, and items to be reminded about in the future; where do these burdens go? Having a central, catch-all, universal &lt;em&gt;box&lt;/em&gt; for all these things is immensely helpful in anyone’s life. The &lt;strong&gt;inbox&lt;/strong&gt; is your loosest and most flexible list, physical box, or digital document for all your ideas — big or small — to be thrown someplace for later evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in the middle of big important task throughout your day is when things are going to pop up and come at you for you to take action on. This is also exactly why some of us have trouble working remotely from home — because you’re constantly reminded about the laundry that has to be folded or the baby that needs changing. When life &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happen and you need to be on top of something is most definitely the proper time to utilize your &lt;strong&gt;inbox&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Birthday Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your sibling calls and says you need to help decide on a theme for a family member’s upcoming birthday party. You quickly assess the situation and realize it’s not urgent so you whip out your &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; notebook or list-making app and merely scribble down enough so you can get back in the mindset you’re in now, later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get back to sibling about birthday party theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day when you’re in the mode to review your inbox items throughout the day is when you’ll see this and properly allocate it to the “birthday” project and set its due date to an appropriate time that leaves enough room for the party to actually be planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, our day was not disrupted when the sibling called to alert us about the thing that needs attention and planning and we were able to take care of it later when we were in the proper mindset to do so. Stopping whatever task we were doing during the day would’ve been careless because something would have to get dropped — you can only focus on one thing at a time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Birthday Scenario (modified)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, life &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen fast and urgent times will not allow you to simply toss something in your inbox for later evaluation. Do not be deceived, however — your inbox is still the most flexible area of your task management system that can save most situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your sibling calls to say the party room is being booked by another family and you’re in a live bidding war with them right now you may have to attend to this near-fiasco. Simply take what you’re currently doing, scribble down the mindset you’re in for it, and include &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in your inbox — the exact inverse of how we handled the non-urgent situation. The inbox is ultimately always there for you in times of leisure and in times of need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, something had to give. If the thing that has to give is the thing you’re currently working on it must find its way to the inbox quickly, safely, and comprehensively. Understanding that you’re going to have to make sense of this task later is crucial to how you record the interrupted task in your inbox. Unfortunately, time is being lost but it should be worth it since the disrupting task was so urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to abuse the inbox. it’s easy to go through life thinking you have this magical system that accepts anything from grand ideas like writing a book to small objects like the loose screws you found under your chair. In a perfect, world we wouldn’t even use the inbox because we’d have enough time to properly allocate tasks and objects as they come. But when we have no choice but to drop something in for the sake of remembering to handle it later it’s the optimal solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding time at the end of the day to reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Importance-of-Inbox-Zero&quot;&gt;inbox zero&lt;/a&gt; can act as your zen &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; time as well as allowing yourself the opportunity to maintain your system and ultimately your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may find yourself &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Scanning-Inbox&quot;&gt;skimming your inbox&lt;/a&gt; for something to do right away. Although this can be effective if the task you choose is as quick as sending a text message, it’s important to not misuse the inbox for these purposes in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the purpose of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; inbox is understood it’s most important to stay on top of it. The last thing anyone wants to is to come to their inbox at the end of the week finding hundreds of random thoughts that aren’t comprehensive in any way. Concluding what works for you along with what has worked historically is the optimal method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Skimming Your Inbox to Find What You Like&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMXUt9A4txc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going through your inbox of unallocated tasks and actions to decide what you’re going to do next and plan out your day, it’s very likely you’ll be rummaging through an unorganized pile of a week’s worth of droppings that haven’t been fully defined yet. Most of the time they’re going to be the small things like, &amp;quot;read this article&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;call sibling for birthday gift ideas&amp;quot;. Although it’s not ideal, it’s okay to have these things floating around in your inbox so long as you take care of them immediately or organize them properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, you’re going to come across a bigger task in your inbox like, &amp;quot;write table of contents for mystery novel we’re working on&amp;quot;. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is a much bigger task in your inbox that you might never get done if you’re viewing your inbox incorrectly. &lt;strong&gt;Skimming through your inbox trying to find the most convenient thing to do at any given time will cause bigger and more time-sensitive tasks to fall through the cracks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your todo list’s inbox isn’t structured to handle priority or scale. It’s merely there to help you drop anything at any time for your organizing pleasure later. If you’re going through it looking for something to do, you’re almost always going to choose the things that are easiest and quickest. However, you should be handling the things in chronological order — in the same order in which you added them in the first place. By that standard, you’ll always be getting things done before they become too outdated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it like rotating milk; when you buy a new carton of milk, it goes behind the current carton so that the opened one gets used and the new one is still fresh when it runs out. If you blocked the current carton with the newer one and continued to buy milk regularly, that carton in the back will grow so sour it’ll stink up the entire house. Don’t let your tasks become so stale they stink up your entire todo list! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re supposed to be choosing your tasks based on what you &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be doing, not what you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like doing. You may never feel like calling the bank for sorting out your mortgage, but you know there is a time and place when you ought to be doing it. Your inbox alone has no concept of what you ought to be doing, it only has a concept of what you have yet to organize properly and therefore isn’t the proper location to decide or not decide to do things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, deciding which tasks to tackle on the fly like this is setting the day up for failure since you’re always going to gravitate toward easier tasks and the more difficult tasks are the ones that should be done at the start of the day. Much like the Bimodal philosophy explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hC2P5qKdPo&quot;&gt;Cal Newport’s Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, most of your energy and creativity are present in the morning — knocking out the easier tasks during that time is wasting the more valuable energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to organize and allocate your inbox as soon as possible at all times — even though it’ll be necessary to cherry-pick tasks directly sometimes, it’ll always be important to be sure you’re going in order of first appearance and not the order of what looks easy and fun. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Will Teach You To Be Rich: Book Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/I-Will-Teach-You-Book"/>
   <updated>2017-10-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;I Will Teach You To Be Rich: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2sLAEwr-co&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve followed Ramit Sethi’s blog and online presence for quite a while already. Although I’ve always been a follower of Dave Ramsey as well and maintain my finances in &lt;a href=&quot;ynab.com&quot;&gt;YNAB&lt;/a&gt;, I figured there might be something to get out of &lt;em&gt; I Will Teach You To Be Rich&lt;/em&gt; — indeed there was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/iwillteachbook.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mindset vs. Budget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit’s main tactic for saving money seems to be one that revolves around changing your mindset to not needing expensive and luxurious things that you know you cannot afford. This was fun to read and see someone else’s take on budgeting; as someone who uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zbb.asp&quot;&gt;ZBB&lt;/a&gt; (zero-based budgeting) method, I already get myself in the right mindset by looking at the numbers considering that plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit’s ideas here seem to be perfect for the neophyte who just got a new job and may end up blowing all their paychecks on unneeded avocados, but it simply didn’t add much practical value to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are we Saving? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was something I hadn’t really thought about until I read it here. We all have some vague idea of why we’re saving, investing, and such, but Ramit got me thinking very specifically. Sure, we all want to retire wealthy, live on an island, and ride the &amp;nbsp;spaceship to Mars for a summer, but those goals are so far out and distant that it’s easy to fall back into an instant gratification loop and start buying expensive jeans and fancy cocktails again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/&quot;&gt;FI/RE&lt;/a&gt; and paying off debt is simply too grand to keep as your one and only goal. It’s important to give yourself smaller milestones, reasonable goals, and small treats as you progress in your financial journey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Excuses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part about budgeting and saving money for most people is that they’re unable to keep up with the Joneses when they have a strict financial plan. It’s especially difficult when the Joneses are your good friends who drag you along to their expensive outings. Before this text, you may feel implored to spend a lot of money on that fancy hayride your friends are all going to even though you know you can’t really afford it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting tactic laid out in the book is pointing your friends to your budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is going to question you when you say you have to stay late at the office because the boss is keeping everyone for a big presentation. You have an excuse and someone to answer to — it’s out of your hands. You can use this same principle for spending money. The budget says you can only spend $20 more this week on eating out and you already have dinner with your significant other planned. This is a great excuse to get out of the hayride. It’s truly out of your hands since you’re answering to the budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blowing Money to you isn’t blowing money to me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of the text was when Ramit was going through all these people he knows who spend their money on different things and how it’s justifiable to &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; splurge-y. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person was spending thousands of dollars per weekend going out to fancy restaurants, getting bottle service at clubs, and throwing extravagant parties. Another was wearing expensive designer clothing from head to toe. As it turns out, all these scenarios include a lot of fiscally responsible decisions unseen which makes it harder to conclude something negative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial that we don’t look at these people and judge them immediately for being careless with money. Two people who make the same amount and either spend all their money on shoes as opposed to spending all their money on lunch every day can still be saving the same amount. One person values nice shoes while the other values the convenience and enjoyment of the food trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Frugal vs. Cheap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a second conversation to be had here about how the shoe-crazed person may come out gaining even more if they follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/&quot;&gt;Buy-It-For-Life&lt;/a&gt; mentality and their shoes last them a solid decade or longer. This is the difference between being frugal and cheap. Frugal people understand the value and will spend more if they can get more time out of it while cheap people buy the least expensive option right now even if it means buying the same thing again next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It truly is an eyeopener and makes you think twice before you judge how other people are spending their money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Philanthropy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about this a lot. I always imagine that having essentially unlimited funds and having the ability to donate your time and money would be one of the most rewarding things you can do with your life. Hearing Ramit discuss briefly how philanthropy is actually an important thing to him opened my eyes slightly more regarding the practice and puts it in a much more practical way than, say, Dave Ramsey does. Knowing Dave’s methodology and hearing right off that bat that a certain percentage goes to ‘giving’ isn’t very motivational. Understanding that to truly make a difference in anything from an organization to someone’s life you must be passionate about the cause in the first place is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giving&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a chore or a negative side to building wealth but just one more thing that you have access to once you’re there. It’s truly a new world that only an elite few and the &amp;quot;non-averages&amp;quot; get to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; I Will Teach You To Be Rich&lt;/em&gt; is not a deep, heavy, and specialized text about investing and wealth management but an extensive story about how to get started with some extras sprinkled in. You can learn a lot no matter where you are in your financial journey and become rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You finally decide you’re going to start working out more. Maybe you’re given the task to bake the birthday cake for your nephew’s birthday party this upcoming Saturday. You’re a busy person and you have to take control of all these things that are consuming your life. Naturally, we’ll take out our phone or journal and scribble down &amp;quot;work out more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;birthday cake for Saturday&amp;quot; in the to-do list. Although you may be compelled to get in and out of your task manager as soon as possible to avoid wasting time and being less productive, you have to describe things in such a way that your mind can both remember and properly take action upon them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You put these objects in your system as single-actions or just one measly to-do item that can be checked off in the time it takes you to recuperate from a sneeze — that’s far too fragile for something so substantial. Working out more and baking a cake are large tasks — in fact, they’re so large, they’re not even tasks; they’re projects comprised of multiple tasks — some of which might even have sub-tasks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baking a Cake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/caketask.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is three day’s work all under one single checkbox — what are you, some sort of superhuman?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/cakeproj.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better. We’re splitting up the task into actionable items, contextualizing them so we know where we have to be and what each item pertains to, setting a due date so it’s sure to not fall through a crack, and linking to some documentation we need to reference for baking once we reach that action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Working Out More Often&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the task, &amp;quot;Find workout routine and start working out more&amp;quot; can teach us a lot about how to structure tasks and projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/workoutroutine.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find workout routine&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a series of actions by itself. Unfortunately, you don’t have all the information and it’s unclear how long this will take. Researching various routines and making a decision &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an action item but it always hurts accepting that you’re just deciding to decide. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re connecting two things together in your single-action task it’s probably not a single action and you should consider separating them or breaking them down into a project like we’re doing here. If you see a task with two tasks within it, you’re going to be using brainpower you should’ve already spent when recording it in the first place. You may even defer completing the task because it’s less comprehensible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start working out&lt;/strong&gt;: A statement like this is telling you a &lt;em&gt;schedule&lt;/em&gt; is in order. Blocking out time — &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/Deep-Work-Book-Review&quot;&gt;like Cal Newport discusses in &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is a great way to ensure everything gets done and nothing falls through the cracks. When you see that you have every other morning blocked off for working out along with your to-do list encouraging you to check off that you worked out on those days, there are multiple parties holding you accountable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more.&lt;/strong&gt;: A statement like this is telling you &lt;em&gt;forming a habit&lt;/em&gt; is in order. It’s great to schedule and allocate time, but at a certain point, you may want to make something so regular that you form a habit out of it like brushing your teeth, showering, and even falling asleep. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it ever okay to create an action item like this? &lt;em&gt;Sometimes&lt;/em&gt; — if you’re on the train, running around, or in the middle of multiple different tasks, you may want to insert a vague and curt item in your inbox. The important part is that you extrapolate the entire project from that single-action as soon as possible. It’s merely there to remind you to really think it through and plan out the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take time to truly appreciate the difference between projects, tasks, actions, events, and other materials. Understanding what works for you is the most important part and making the system work in tandem with your life is essential to staying organized and productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWin-7YJt5M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine your mailbox — your physical mailbox decorated with your family name and some artwork demonstrating your love for nature, the beach or whatever is appropriate to display on an envelope-collecting box. You walk up to the front stoop, find some mail in the mailbox from the day before without thinking much of it, inhale the fumes of the freshly cut grass, wave to the neighbors, pet the neighborhood dog as your friendly neighbor walks them on your sidewalk, and eventually see the mailman coming. In a panic, you want to empty your mailbox so the mailman doesn’t judge you for having your mail in there from the previous day. You find bills, tasks you have to take action on, &lt;em&gt;save the date&lt;/em&gt;s for weddings you have to take note of, and even insurance information you have to tell the spouse about! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/usps.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re doomed&lt;/strong&gt;. The mailman makes his way over to your messy, unorganized mailbox where he drops more mail on top of the unallocated mail you currently have that has been piling up for days, weeks, maybe even years. You're overwhelmed and decide it’s not even worth organizing; you find contentment in your mess to the point where you revel in the piles of clutter and perhaps create some organized system on top of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbors look over to your mailbox (Mail app badge count&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;ffn1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and cringe. You wonder why you even enjoy keeping everything in your email; there are other management programs that will allow you to hoard this type of data. Email, however, is the one trusted system we all have in common. Email is such a standard we know we’ll always refer back to it in the future - so, if I need that coupon from six months ago, I can usually scroll past 100 unread emails until I find it nestled in my inbox. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you want to maintain an empty inbox at all times. Clear out, allocate, store, defer, and delegate things immediately so you have constant clarity. An initial purge of everything unneeded is necessary and it will hurt at first — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvQViPBAvPk&quot;&gt;the trick, however, is not minding that it hurts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Email&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is something different to all of us. Some keep their email as their todo list. They’ll favorite the emails they want to &amp;quot;cross off&amp;quot; today and keep the emails they need to get &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; this week unread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hate email and only use it when they have to while they get more and more excited about &amp;quot;email killers&amp;quot; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;. These people’s inboxes are usually filled with conversations they know they’ll have to reference later - which brings us to our next type of emailer: The Referencer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; using their email as their primary reference storage and personal wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the confirmation number for the tickets the box office asking for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s my license plate number? I know the insurance company put it in an email somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living like this isn’t terrible, but I can’t imagine it not being exhausting. Relying on a tool that isn’t meant for something for things that are as important as your information and daily planner is begging for disaster. It also prevents you from adhering to the popular &lt;em&gt;Inbox Zero Methodology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/letters.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Inbox Zero?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Inbox Zero is a practical workflow to constantly adhere to while in your email that allows very few (to zero) emails in your inbox at all times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conforming to Inbox Zero means that any time you open your email client you’ll see fresh emails that you have to do something with right away. Whether you’re archiving it on the spot (perhaps you’re subscribed to a newsletter you want to unsubscribe from) replying on the spot, taking note of it a separate entity (your note-taking app or physical journal), or marking in your todo list. All of these outcomes allow you to take the important pieces of the email and archive it to get it out of there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Common Email Mistakes &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the process your mind takes you through when you get an email notification? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a non-exhaustive list of some options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Interesting! Let me read this and forget about it one minute later!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have to read this now and then perform some action based on what it says!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Boring, I’ll open it so the little blue “unread” dot disappears and I can stop worrying about it but have it stay in my inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Boring, I’ll archive it right now. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you chose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting, let me read this and forget about it one minute later!&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what is going through your mind. Are you looking for the instant gratification that this email’s content might give you? Is it urgent enough that you have to open it, read it, and delete it right away? Can it be triaged for later use so you know exactly what to do with it and you control the email instead of the email controlling you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have to read this now and then perform some action based on what it says!&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again. The email is controlling you. You’re going to let some measly text on a virtual letter tell you how to live your life? Sure, sometimes it’s the right thing to do, but more often than not, you’re just looking for an excuse to get something done and wait for the permission of an action item to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This says something about your workflow. What were you doing when you got this email that you’re so easily manipulated into taking action on it right away? Maybe you were doing something less productive so by doing whatever this email says you’ll feel more useful. You should &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be feeling productive. Do not let your email be your todo list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boring, I’ll just open it so the little dot goes away&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning email based on what is read and unread is probably not the best way to manage what is important, unimportant, and what has to be read and ignored. Firstly, it’s not a concrete relationship. You can so easily mark something as read without realizing it and have something fall through the cracks. By taking action on each and every email that comes through, you’ll know exactly where everything is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boring, I’ll archive it now&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inbox Zero Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright. You want to overhaul your email habits, always have a clean slate, and &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; your email instead of your email controlling you. How do you do it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You open your email client and notice three brand new emails. In no particular order, you open one up. It can say so many things - truly, email is a fresh gift with a bow tied on top of it every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scenario A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first email is from your newest client asking if you can send over some samples of your latest project. What do you do with this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The old you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before becoming enlightened with the Inbox Zero methodology, you may have read this email, decided you have to take action on it later and just left the email in your inbox. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; you even marked it as unread so the little blue dot next to it reminds you to look at it again later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new you&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since adhering to the Inbox Zero methodology, you now understand that you must do something with this email right now. Archive it, delete it, forward it, snooze it, get it out of the inbox! In this case, you add &amp;quot;Send client samples&amp;quot; to your trusted to-do list and archive the email. Maybe you’ll even copy the reference link to the email and paste it along with your &amp;quot;Send sample&amp;quot; todo item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scenario B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next email is from your dear friend who sent over the ticket confirmation and info regarding the musical you’re going to see next month. This is tricky because there are a few acceptable methods here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snoozing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at reference material here. We know we’re going to need this information when we make it to the theatre and we’ll need to take note of this date right away. Go ahead and mark the event in your calendar so you prevent double-booking and &lt;em&gt;snooze&lt;/em&gt; the email to the day of the event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you’ll get the email in your inbox just as if it were sent that day. You’re able to reference it immediately and archive it once the show is through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safer, but slightly more convoluted, method here is to properly reference the information in your trusted system. This can be your note-taking application, the physical journal you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you’re going to check back with every day, or an actual file in a folder you keep in the cabinet under your desk. The main idea here is that it’s somewhere you know you’ll be able to find it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keeping up with it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get it — email is hard, infinite, and sometimes just naturally a messy and unorganized place no matter how often you try keeping it in order. The big thing to keep in mind is how your inbox is just a place for your life’s information &lt;em&gt;just until you read it for the first time&lt;/em&gt; and decide what to do it with immediately after. Adhering to the simple ideas of just clearing out your emails and inserting all the information in your other entities that are meant for them will clear your mind and make you infinitely more productive and responsive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/manyemail.jpg&quot;/&gt; The dreaded iOS badge count. Just &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/09/remove-red-badge-icons-from-apps-ios/&quot;&gt;disable it&lt;/a&gt; at that point.  &lt;a href=&quot;#ffn1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x21A9;&amp;#xFE0E;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Deep Work: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6hC2P5qKdPo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times a day do you check your phone — what are you looking for? Are you trying to see breaking news about celebrity deaths, checking up on a live election you’re closely tied to, or something that has a large impact on the planet? Or are you just waiting for a new meme to be sent in one of the twelve 5+ participant group chats you’re in with all your different friend-groups? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverting our attention from &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; — whether that is programming, writing, selling, or more menial roles like data entry — to seek instant gratification like a funny meme, gag article, or something providing little value compared to what you’re actually trying to accomplish is an extremely common problem that is only getting worse with the rise of social media and the fall of people’s attention span. It’s impossible, nowadays, to stay focused on one thing for an extended period of time. We’re so obsessed with fresh, riveting, breaking news no matter the caliber that we push aside the significant tasks to instantly gratify ourselves. Deep work is becoming less and less prevalent — &lt;em&gt;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&lt;/em&gt; dives into why this happens and teaches how to get back to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/deepwork.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multitasking is a Myth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re multitasking, you’re not getting things done as effectively as you could be. There is no such thing as multitasking because there will always be one thing that is taking more of your energy and brainpower than the other. ‘Watching’ a movie in the background whilst working is going to diminish your work and leave you confused at the movie’s ending. Listening to a podcast while writing a book is going to leave you with an incoherent book and barely any insights gained from the podcast since you were barely focused on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a few tabs open — one with a form where you’re filling out a proposal and the other with your Twitter feed — and you’re switching between the two fairly regularly you’re cheating yourself of valuable time. Switching and mental costs occurring while going back and forth are taking up so much time to the point where you could’ve added an entirely new task if they were all done sequentially. By shifting your focus to one thing after the other, the mindset from the other task is still fresh in your mind and will be lingering in there during the entire duration of this new task. Plus, the cost of &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to get in the right mindset in the first place is taking up more time than it’s worth since you’re going to have that same switching cost multiple times if you’re trying to multitask your way through it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your different &lt;em&gt;modes&lt;/em&gt; and which one you’re in is a big step to understanding how you work best. If you’re in &lt;em&gt;phone call mode&lt;/em&gt; you should take care of all the phone calls that have to get done that you’re aware of. This way, you’re mentally prepared for talking, in the right mindset, and you can get everything in that category done. If you’re in &lt;em&gt;programming mode&lt;/em&gt; you know you must get into deep work and disconnect yourself from outside distractions. By switching modes and taking calls while trying to program, you ruin both tasks. Bad code is going to get written if you’re taking calls before and after every new method you create — similarly, your clients aren’t going to be very happy that you may seem distracted and distant on the phone since you’re still calculating business logic for the program in your mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why programs like Slack along with all the other new communication apps are disliked by so many productive workers — they’re constantly being drawn to this endless stream of chatting, gifs, emojis, and such. Even worse than your friend’s group message, this is work-related — so it’s essential to communicate with the rest of the team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text discusses a few different methodologies that can be followed for maximizing deep work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monastic&lt;/strong&gt; is used by avoiding things for long periods of time. Ignoring outside events, news, and such for the length of an entire month will drastically improve deep work. If you’re trying to finish your great American novel, try leaving your family and living in a cabin in the woods for a few months to eliminate absolutely everything that may keep you from finishing. Obviously, for some, this may not be the most practical method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bimodal&lt;/strong&gt; is an interesting methodology. Here, you’d schedule all your deep work for the beginning of the day. You’d say that you have however many chapters to finish by noon, however many lines of code to finish by 3 pm, and enjoy the rest of the day. Knowing that you have the rest of the day ‘off’ after getting deep work done until the mid-afternoon is actually incentive to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; deep and be maximally productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Rhythmic&lt;/strong&gt; methodology might be familiar to you if you’ve ever considered adhering to the Pomodoro Technique. This forces you to get deep work done for, say, twenty minutes and gives you a five-minute break at the end of that cycle — then you repeat. It’s easy to pick up and popular among a lot of software developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalistic&lt;/strong&gt; is my least favorite. This allows you to pick up deep work wherever and whenever throughout the day and depending on your availability. It’s very spontaneous and worries me since it allows for no mental preparation and much less scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting in the Zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. K. Rowling got &lt;em&gt;in the zone&lt;/em&gt; by checking into five-star hotels. She felt that her writing was better and she was more productive and efficient when her environment encouraged it. She planned to get herself in the zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tricks to be sure you’re able to find deep work very often is to plan the luckiness that is getting in the zone. You may go to bed one day feeling extremely proud of yourself for getting so much done — but you should go to bed every night feeling that way. What was it about that day that allowed you to accomplish so much? Whatever it was, do it every day and your productivity won’t revolve around luck but around your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plan Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things Newport has ever taught me is the idea of planning just about everything. When I first became infatuated with becoming a more productive and effective person, Newport’s blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/&quot;&gt;post on scheduling every minute&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first things I devoured and implemented straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone may want to plan their lives so granularly but if you do you better believe all the things on that list are going to get done. Seeing your day at a high level and each hour partitioned and allocated to certain tasks is the only way to ensure nothing slips through the cracks. You can have tasks and projects organized in your management applications or notebooks, but sitting down and planning the day forces you to be honest with yourself and truly be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt; explained a lot of things I was already familiar with by following Newport’s methodologies prior. It’s very eye-opening to see just how easily we’re manipulated by the draw of instant gratification and how quickly we’ll abandon all our important tasks. &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dying and it’s crucial that we cultivate all the deep work we can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/TEX-Yoda-Build-Log-and-Review&quot;&gt;TEX Yoda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYJ5JHWGEOA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mare’s &lt;em&gt; Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderful aggregation of interviews, insights, real-world trial and errors, and inspiration. It’s packed with information that is actionable and easy to stick in your back pocket for when you face interesting issues that you would never consider being prepared for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in &lt;em&gt;Traction&lt;/em&gt; not only because it was an interesting topic but also because I was heavily involved in DuckDuckGo — &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;using the service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Quack-Hack-New-York-City/&quot;&gt;advocating the Instant Answer platform at meetups&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NickCalabs/zeroclickinfo-goodies&quot;&gt;submitting code&lt;/a&gt; on their open source repos as a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckhack.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckHack&lt;/a&gt;. To immerse myself more in the privacy, growth, and startup culture I figured what better way than to read the CEO’s book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to gain traction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways your product can get traction, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@yegg/the-19-channels-you-can-use-to-get-traction-93c762d19339&quot;&gt;19 actually&lt;/a&gt;. They’re:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Blogs

        &lt;p&gt;One of the most popular forms of marketing and the most effective form of &lt;em&gt;content marketing&lt;/em&gt;. Blogging helps users find your product or service based on similar issues, problems, and stories that you’re writing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Publicity

        &lt;p&gt;This requires some spotlight — maybe even some finagling for the sake of fame. Publicity will come when you do something grand, speak with someone popular, or just shout in a crowded room. Most say that no publicity is bad publicity. If people are talking and you’re on their minds, they already care about you and your products at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unconventional PR

        &lt;p&gt;My main idea for this type of PR is following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulg&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; methodology of &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot;&gt;doing things that don’t scale&lt;/a&gt;. This might involve publicity stunts and even going door-to-door — things that clearly won’t work in the long run but that are somehow managing to get people looking at you right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Search Engine Marketing

        &lt;p&gt;Clearly, yegg knows this topic very well. DDG does make revenue on advertising as do all search engines. If anyone tells you Google is in the business of cloud storage, Android phones, or video, you can tell them they’re not wrong but that they’d be more accurate if they simply said they’re in the advertising business. Everything else is just shiny products to deliver ads and it’s a great tool to use to gain some traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Social and Display Ads

        &lt;p&gt;Banner ads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Offline Ads

        &lt;p&gt;Think commercials and Times Square. I always feel Super Bowl ads get me hooked on products and love watching the new ways companies innovate with only a 30-second time slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SEO

        &lt;p&gt;There are entire departments of tech companies that devote themselves to SEO. The reality is that sometimes you need to be at the top of the list for someone to click you and it’s very important you’re on the top of that list no matter what their original query was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Content Marketing

        &lt;p&gt;Ultimately similar to the &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; tactic above but more granularly covering the main objective here which is to get people’s eyes on your content because it relates to them then selling them things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Email Marketing

        &lt;p&gt;A great way to reach your customer or user directly. Send them personalized notes and ultimately sell them stuff!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Viral Marketing

        &lt;p&gt;Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://viral-loops.com/&quot;&gt;Viral Loops&lt;/a&gt; have entire businesses based on helping you utilize this tactic. Dropbox is one of the largest case studies for Viral marketing. Getting free storage - which seems like a tangible and valuable thing - just for getting a friend to sign up for a service was an incredibly successful move by Dropbox and helped get them a large user base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Engineering

        &lt;p&gt;Building tools and products to help grow your brand is a great way to get more eyes on you and your products. If you’re writing a book on photography and build a photography app that helps take better pictures using some of the tactics you discuss in the book, it’s going to get people talking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Business Development

        &lt;p&gt;Sales but grander. Big things to keep in mind with this is that both parties have to come out happy. We help you integrate our service so your users can have more variety and easy access and in turn, we’re getting more traction because we’re available on more platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sales

        &lt;p&gt;Instead of partnering with businesses like Business Development, you’re partnering with paying customers. Selling is important for any business that intends to create revenue and good sales approaches will ensure quality traction for your company and product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Affiliate Programs

        &lt;p&gt;Even if you never heard the word ‘affiliate’ you’ve probably been the victim of an Amazon affiliate link where someone got a commission from something you bought. It’s a solid example of how using other channels to provide access to another channel can be beneficial for multiple parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Existing Platforms

        &lt;p&gt;Using apps and services that already have large user bases and audiences is a quick way of accessing many people at once. If you’re able to utilize someone else’s audience by providing them with information or any other value, you can shine a big ad on a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trade Shows

        &lt;p&gt;This may seem old-fashioned if you’re heavily in the startup community glaring at your codebase all day, but there are many business owners, consumers, and everyone in between that attend trade shows just waiting to be hooked on your traction train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Offline Events

        &lt;p&gt;Similarly, events such as meetups and conferences offer huge and specialized audiences that can help grow a fanbase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Speaking Engagements

        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes within offline events and sometimes their own entity, if someone who is well-known is speaking at some public place you better believe people are flocking there - those are the people that can help gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Community Building

        &lt;p&gt;As a Community Leader at DuckDuckGo, I can say for certain that I’ve gained friendships and partnerships with people and companies that are fans of the platform and that would love to assist in the future and who I wouldn’t hesitate to help either. Hosting and organizing events and gathering likeminded people is one of the most powerful ways to garner a community and gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re illuminated with nearly twenty different tactics that can be used to get your business going, you’ll be glad to hear that it’s impossible to know which will be your most successful method. Testing will have to be done to help understand which is working well and which might be working better than expected. The idea is to hit every single option and track which areas are performing well. If billboards and speaking engagements are where you’re converting most often, it might be time to turn some of your copywriters into meetup organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Product vs. Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may surprise you just how highly &lt;em&gt;Traction&lt;/em&gt; regards marketing. Toward the start of the text, the 50% rule is introduced outlining how half of your time should focus on the product while an entire second half should be focused on marketing and ultimately getting traction. Some might glorify &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; focusing on traction because it would imply they have a superior product that didn’t require marketing, but Silicon Valley investors disagree. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/12/marc-andreessen-visits-peter-thiels-stanford-class-to-talk-startups-how-he-invests-the-future/&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one reason that we pass on entrepreneurs we’d otherwise like to back is focusing on product to the exclusion of everything else. We tend to cultivate and glorify this mentality in the Valley. We’re all enamored with lean startup mode. Engineering and product are key. There is a lot of genius to this, and it has helped create higher quality companies. But the dark side is that it seems to give entrepreneurs excuses not to do the hard stuff of sales and marketing. Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don’t have a good distribution strategy. Even worse is when they insist that they don’t need one, or call no distribution strategy a “viral marketing strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear it all the time: “We’ll be like Salesforce.com—no sales team required, since the product will sell itself.” This is always puzzling. Salesforce.com has a huge, modern sales force. The tagline is “No software,” not “No sales.” AH is a sucker for people who have sales and marketing figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound outlandish or even trite depending on what your philosophies are, but traction and the methods of getting it are sometimes more important than the product itself. There’s a reason Apple, a company that makes products perfectly capable of &amp;quot;selling themselves&amp;quot;, still has extremely well-paid marketing executives like Phil Schiller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meta Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of the &lt;em&gt;Traction&lt;/em&gt; book wasn’t even anything in the text but the metadata that the authors provide about how they sold the book and the different channels they used along the way. Even during the process of selling the book after launch and all the events, ad campaigns, and whatnot are documented in great detail and provide extremely insightful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling a book can be seen as a microcosm of starting a business. There are goals and metrics but just one product without any employees so it’s much easier to manage. Sharing the things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@yegg/getting-traction-for-traction-book-12-328-copies-by-the-numbers-d62cbb1527f6&quot;&gt;Amazon results&lt;/a&gt;, sources, and more truly provide value for someone who hasn’t gone through this rigamarole just yet. Similarly interesting is the insights provided about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@yegg/37-617-copies-of-traction-by-the-numbers-what-we-made-and-how-much-it-cost-41ff675c5965&quot;&gt;how many books were sold&lt;/a&gt; and on which platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do plan on using some of these same tactics on my own and when I have the opportunities to. I won’t be buying billboards for my mere blog posts but certainly see the value in other companies investing in things like that such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geomarketing.com/why-did-snapchat-takeover-times-square-without-geofilters&quot;&gt;Snapchat in Times Square&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of tackling all facets of marketing and drilling into the ones that stick is a principle that can be applied to many things in business as well. I’m excited to use the ideas in &lt;em&gt;Traction&lt;/em&gt; and can’t wait for any updated versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mare’s &lt;em&gt; Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth&lt;/em&gt; was one of my very first startup books. Around the same time is when I picked up Nir Eyal’s &lt;em&gt;Hooked&lt;/em&gt; and started &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Hard-Things-Review&quot;&gt;idolizing figures like Ben Horowitz&lt;/a&gt; and other business gurus — I’m glad I’m part of it now. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power Of No: Book Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Power-of-No"/>
   <updated>2017-09-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Power-of-No</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;The Power Of No: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL3IMOymNK0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Altucher’s second-most-recent publication, &lt;em&gt;The Power of No: Because One Little Word Can Bring Health, Abundance, and Happiness&lt;/em&gt; gets deeper than I would’ve anticipated. Seemingly, the book would touch upon ways that saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; can help you achieve the things you truly want to do and how we please people all the time when we know we shouldn’t. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go into nearly all of these points but there are other aspects to this idea I would’ve never considered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/powerofno.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; can keep you from dying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. The text starts off pretty morbidly when Altucher compares saying yes to smoking, drinking, and other things that can easily kill you. The idea is that by saying yes to people when you don’t really want to &lt;em&gt;kills&lt;/em&gt; you slightly inside in more ways than one. When you have a big deadline in just a few days but your longtime buddy asks to help them paint the garage, some may please the friend when the obvious choice is to help yourself first and get some work done. People pleasers may not take themselves into consideration here, cramp up, and agree to help with the daunting task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of your longtime buddy who seeks help painting, you also have to ask yourself if this friend of yours truly provides enough value in your life. The text forces you to think about people who really make you feel productive, good, and proud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider these same friends when you ask &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to paint &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; garage. Are they truly enjoying being there helping you, or do they feel forced because they were afraid to say no leaving you feeling guilty because you realize they don’t truly want to be there? The text does a great job of not only making you more comfortable saying no but also understanding how to not force others to say yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What lies in our power to do, lies in our power not to do” ~ Aristotle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don’t please others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This heading is slightly negative. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a decent human and please others but you shouldn’t please others before yourself nor should you please them so much that it becomes pandering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/the-journal/ryan-holiday&quot;&gt;Kevin Rose’s podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Ryan Holiday says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How much of this decision is motivated by not wanting to disappoint someone and what would you say about it in eighty years?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really great quote to play back in your mind whenever someone tries to take some of your time. Firstly, knowing that what you’re agreeing to is actually pleasing the other person and disappointing yourself is the most basic test that every decision should pass. Secondly, it makes you think even harder when you consider how you’d think about it eighty years from now. Are you going to remember the relationship you cultivated with the neighbor helping them paint more than you will help your on-and-off friend with the groceries? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of simply thinking about it in the sense of saving time for things you really want to be doing, you can also think of it as a personal fulfillment hindrance when you say yes. If you’re sitting at the office being barked at to complete these reports you really don’t have any passion for, saying yes to that task is keeping you from being yourself. The real you doesn’t want to be an accountant but instead wants to be a programmer. Saying no to a task that helps you climb the wrong ladder could be very beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to say no - blaming others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to say no and mustering up the courage to possibly disappoint is a difficult thing to overcome. Accountability is the one thing people can’t argue. No one is going to question you if you say you have to go to the office on a weekday afternoon - it’s perfectly reasonable office-hours and they’d be crazy to suggest quitting your job for the sake of getting lunch with them instead. In this case, you’re off the hook and welcome to say no to other things because your priorities are clearly set on something else that is extremely socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making people have that same understanding regarding other things isn’t as easy but certainly possible. If you hold yourself accountable to your personal task manager, todo list, and/or calendar, you can easily blame &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. You’re technically still blaming yourself and your schedule, but by saying your past-self allocated this time for something and you can’t upset your plan helps them put their request in perspective in regards to your goals and things you’re trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Avoid anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of manufactured anxiety the book explains deals with traveling and flying. If you’re going on a plane in a few hours but have a desire to watch this popular documentary about plane crashes, you’re creating anxiety for yourself if you can’t handle the themes of the movie so close to a flight. Saying no to that film and watching SpongeBob instead might be extremely necessary for your wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying no to distractions is another way to possibly feel more joy than you’re used to. By neglecting to check your texts and Twitter while wondering the streets and running errands and saying no to social media, it’s entirely possible to find excitement in the real world. It also forces you to give more attention to the things you may not normally. Giving the cashier your undivided attention and being pleasant can really brighten someone’s day - the look of a lonely person feeling noticed for the first time in a day is one you won’t forget!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Four bodies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the most of the Power of No requires you to get in touch with your four bodies: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. I have no doubt that to truly becoming enlightened in all of these areas may take half a lifetime, but it’s something to keep in mind and to constantly consider with most, if not all, of your daily decisions - most of which you’ll (hopefully) say no to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When to say no&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to know the balance here. We all know some people who just say no to everything because they’re recluses, depressed, or just have no drive to &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t say no to &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; to the point where it becomes a problem and people start worrying about you. Similarly, don’t neglect the people who are important to you. Think back to the garage painting friend, if they’re in that handful of friends that you consider your inner circle and that make you a better person, give them the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There truly is a lot of power to the word no and utilizing it correctly can help you accomplish the things you want to accomplish while misusing it can ruin your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is a Task - and how do you manage them?</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;What is a Task - and how do you manage them?&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbgJZtiYhcg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn’t it great being a student? Teachers and professors just laid all the tasks, assignments and exam dates, out for you. There was really no planning for you to do. Planning and deciding what everyone should be doing and when they should be doing it is the hard part. When new tasks and projects pop into your mind you don’t have a teacher or assistant to break it all down into step-by-step action items while telling you when to get it all done and by what date. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BT2IOwJgUCd/&quot;&gt;It is up to you, and doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the challenge we’ll work on today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple parts to getting this exactly right and it’ll take half a lifetime to get to a point where you feel truly comfortable with your system so we’ll just go over some ideas one at a time starting with &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is a Task?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; is easy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;ffn1&quot; href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — a piece of work to be done or undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind creates new action items for you every waking moment. Let’s look at some examples and figure out how to manage them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pick up celery from the grocery store&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Call back Brad about the conference&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look up children’s picture books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at these tasks contextually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pick up celery from the &lt;strong&gt;grocery store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Call back &lt;strong&gt;Brad&lt;/strong&gt; about the conference&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look up&lt;/strong&gt; children’s picture books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at them in a project hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick up celery&lt;/strong&gt; from the grocery store&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call&lt;/strong&gt; back Brad about the &lt;strong&gt;conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look up children’s picture books &lt;strong&gt;(??)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you record these tasks you’ll want to add as much information as you can so you know exactly where to go with it once you refer to it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Picking up celery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You most likely have an easily accessible reference list somewhere that houses all the things you have to pick up while you’re out on your errands. Mark this task contextually so that it gets done when you’re running your &lt;em&gt;errands&lt;/em&gt;. When you’re driving around and say to yourself, &amp;quot;let me see which errands must get done,&amp;quot; you’ll immediately see that celery has to get picked up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, if instead you decide to check things off your grocery list while you’re there it’ll be taken care of within that list and discarded once we refer back to the contexts (unless the software being used handles this for you). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Calling Brad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/org-breakdown.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delving into this task and recognizing the keywords help us organize and track it. &lt;em&gt;Call&lt;/em&gt; means it’s going in a project, context, or list of all the calls we have to make. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brad&lt;/em&gt; means that it’s going with all the other things Brad is involved with. We may also have to ask Brad about the upcoming interview or a holiday party we’re planning so this helps us ensure he’s being informed of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conference&lt;/em&gt; tells us this is part of something larger. There may be dozens of other action items, reference items, important dates, and whatnot relating to this conference and we need to make sure calling Brad is included in that pile. Ultimately, though, this task &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be included in multiple projects so we can find it when we’re in &lt;em&gt;calling&lt;/em&gt; mode and &lt;em&gt;conference&lt;/em&gt; mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Looking up children’s picture books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We failed while recording this action item. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot rely on your brain to remind you about why you asked it to do something. Why are we looking up children’s books? OK, I did it — I read through an entire picture book. Can I mark this as done or was there something I had to do this &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The not-so-simple tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things aren’t always easy. Sometimes you’ll have a task that relates to a project, has deadlines, is waiting for someone else to take action, and/or even can’t be done until a certain date. How do we record these and be sure nothing falls through the cracks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a modified list from earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pick up celery from the grocery store &lt;strong&gt;by Saturday &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the kids’ sporting event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Call back Brad after we get the information regarding the conference &lt;strong&gt; that we’re carpooling to together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Look up children’s picture books &lt;strong&gt;for inspiration regarding the story book we plan on writing about a talking keyboard and mouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Picking up celery by Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous and more specific versions of these tasks are both valid. While one of them is a simple action item that has to be on your list for when you’re shopping or running errands the other one &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that same thing but with a deadline, purpose, and likely included in a project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filing this away can be as easy as inserting it in the correct place or building out the project if one does not exist already. The &lt;em&gt;Sporting Event&lt;/em&gt; should be its own project that, as a whole, is due on the day of the event — meanwhile, the actual event’s date and time will be marked in your calendar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sporting Event&lt;/em&gt; will include single actions such as &lt;em&gt;order uniform&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tell grandma to show up&lt;/em&gt; along with sub-projects that have to be done in some sequential order such as &lt;em&gt;Film Event&lt;/em&gt; that includes &lt;em&gt;pack camera&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;edit footage&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;post to the team’s website&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you review a task like picking up celery, the proper thing to do might be to add it to the list of single actions under the event’s project while contextualizing or tagging it to your errands or grocery list. That way the task is included with the big picture’s overall goal but can be found when you need it without scanning all your projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Calling Brad about the conference and carpooling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the celery situation, Brad’s phone call task is going to be filed under the list of single action items regarding the conference. Of course, it’ll also be contextualized to be easily found when we’re in &lt;em&gt;phone mode&lt;/em&gt;. To prevent switching costs going back and forth between web browsing and making phone calls, knocking out all the phone calls we have to make all at once is the best approach. The only way to achieve that is to have all the phone calls listed together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-hanging fruit in this task is the carpooling aspect to it all. Something is going to have to be done before and/or after something else. We may have to learn more about the situation to tell Brad about it or we may have to learn more before we call Brad. Either way, it’s the perfect situation for a sequential project. Ultimately, there are going to be tasks that simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be performed until something else has been done. These tasks &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be available to review so you always understand the scope of what is going on, but you won’t be bothered with notifications or daily todo items for things that simply can’t be done because we’re waiting for something else to happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Looking up children’s picture books for the book we’re writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out we were setting reminders to read up on popular children’s books for a reason. In our system, there should be a project already being maintained that carries all of the information and actions regarding the picture book we plan on publishing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neglecting to attach this action of doing research to the actual project leaves us with no scope. We don’t know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re doing something. Knowing why things are being done and planning accordingly is one of the most important steps to getting things done — next to doing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our newfound knowledge and more detailed task, we can accordingly record the action item into the &lt;em&gt;write children’s book&lt;/em&gt; project next to, “Create job description for illustrator” and “finalize table of contents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do all your deciding now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be very hard to determine what has to go where and why you recorded something later on. Your mind is in the moment and motivated right now. File the task in the right area and add any lingering notes to it as soon as you have it so you can really take action on it later and avoid anything slipping through the cracks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, there’s no &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; system. Whatever works for you is the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;Defining &lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; is a little more complex, but we’ll talk about that in another post. &lt;a href=&quot;#ffn1&quot;&gt;&amp;#x21A9;&amp;#xFE0E;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>The Phoenix Project: Book Review</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Phoenix-Project"/>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;The Phoenix Project: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; is a story about IT and the man who is thrown into managing it. It shows the day-by-day interactions between the executives, employees, and everyone in-between. We learn about project management, product management, software development, operations, and even some politics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; is the newest innovation in the company that will make them more competitive and profitable. I understand it as the great big project that will put everyone and the business on the map. There’s a lot of work to be done for Phoenix. We quickly learn it’s overly ambitious and no one’s expectations are managed properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love referring to the &lt;strong&gt;Project Management Triangle&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a graphic that basically states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost, quality, time — choose two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the beginning of the story when we’re learning more about Phoenix, there’s a lot of discussion about how the current technical team is being stressed too thin with bigger feature requests, less time, and less money. Eventually, this leads to more and more features getting delayed. The Quality Assurance team ends up catching more broken features for each one that gets fixed. The past time crunches and rushing seem to have harmed the company even if they brought instant gratification when they were initially implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a real eye-opener when you don’t realize there is true damage being done by building another feature and adding more complexity to your project. Deployment intervals were being lengthened just for the opportunity to build more features which ultimately causes more bugs than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0JscA-ABLI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Parts Unlimited&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company the story revolves around is less important than the day-to-day operations that occur inside it. It is fun to create an entire world around the main story, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; - half the fun of these &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; is learning about the different languages, colonies, worlds, reading and marking up the maps, and whatnot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford don’t create an entire universe as complex as &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, they do use common and popular methodologies, techniques, and management principles that really help the reader relate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing the unfamiliar and messy aspects of the poorly managed Parts Unlimited with the well-known and proven workflow techniques like Kanban and Agile does a great job of engaging anyone who works in a similar environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, this story touched me at exactly the right time in my career. I was working at a fresh startup with a small technical team with big ambitions (and big, complex, features). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were always debating about spending the next month taking care of technical debt, building new and shiny features, or even building a counterpart web-app. One of the most inspiring parts of &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; was when they decide to halt all feature development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s shocking because we think of new features as exactly what you might need to acquire new users and more revenue. However, the true value of a software company lies in its reliability — you only get that with quality and properly built technical stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the book may seem superfluous since much of what is discussed is standard practice. It took many companies like the one in the book doing what they were doing for everyone to buckle down and realize there are correct ways to manage projects and people. This doesn’t take away from the fact that the novel is extremely well-written and quite fun to read if you enjoy learning about different systems and methodologies while feeling the pressure and suspense from the higher-ups in the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Parts Unlimited is an interesting company to read about with interesting people in charge. The story is exciting enough to read for fun but has the huge added benefit of learning how to manage along with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear, all the time, young chaps tell me about their wedding. I respond with, “You’re married? You’re only 19”. They’ll chuckle and quickly explain they’re not married yet but have the entire affair planned out. Some might see this activity as presumptuous, eager, or even unhealthy - I say it’s genius. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were told to focus on a certain color you’d immediately scan the area and find all instances of that color. If you told yourself you’re going to buy a certain type of car, you’d immediately start noticing all of those cars currently on the road; you might even think there are more cars like this since you started thinking about it. It’s called the Baader Meinhof effect and you can use it to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on your end goal you’ll end up seeing opportunity and taking action toward that goal without even realizing it. This goes far beyond planning your wedding, the partner, and what you plan on serving during the cocktail hour. If your end goal is to write a New York Times Bestseller, become an Oscar-winning director, or even to be president of your child’s school’s PTA, your day-to-day life will revolve around those goals. Next time you find a writing opportunity, chance to speak with a successful director, or mingle with suburban parents, you’re much more likely to take action since that goal is in the back of your mind and everything you do should be making that more and more possible every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine your life with a beginning and an end. Where do the big events occur? Where do your chapters begin and end? Point them out on the timeline of your life - it won’t go according to that schedule by any means, but planning for it is one of the most important things you can do. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World: Review</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World: Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Gillibrand’s &lt;em&gt;Off the Sidelines&lt;/em&gt; starts off as an inspiring tale of a young lady who ventures into politics. A wonderful display of feminism turns quickly into a powerful political piece while even still touching on the personal issues of Gillibrand’s personal and professional life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from a mother, senator, and wife, the issues of affordable daycare and paid family sick leave weigh much more than if they came from someone else. Gillibrand shuns the thought that many people believe women are greedy or entitled by wanting to earn a living and care for their family. Gillibrand states how government should celebrate families and help them thrive instead of throttling them by making it more difficult to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To emphasize the good Gillibrand is trying to accomplish while in office, some other issues she cares deeply about are the repeal of &lt;em&gt;Don’t ask, don’t tell&lt;/em&gt; and the passing of the 9/11 healthcare bill. Sponsored by herself along with Carolyn Maloney, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Zadroga_9/11_Health_and_Compensation_Act&quot;&gt;James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act&lt;/a&gt; is meant to provide health monitoring and financial aid to first responders of the 9/11 attacks. With numerous responders and volunteers visiting Washington to tell their stories of what it was like at the World Trade Center, it was a relief to many the bill finally passed in 2011 - even if the Senator did have to eat her pride and cry on the Senate floor for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ambition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambition is an interesting thing in politics that Gillibrand happily digs deep into. Three lovely rules that are laid out in the text regarding ambition go like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ambition does not negate femininity. A mother ambitious enough to protect her children should be seen as powerful — not weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believing in yourself is always the first step to get people to believe in you and respect you. Your confidence and faith in yourself will immediately translate to others having confidence in you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last one is my favorite.
- &amp;quot;Draw your own map.&amp;quot; It’s okay to learn from others, emulate others, and be inspired by others, but if you’re looking for someone in history who was born in your small town, went to the same college as you did, and grew up to achieve the same things you want to achieve, you’ll never find that person and you might be motivated to give up because it’s obviously not possible. However, instead of being demotivated because no one has done exactly what you want to do, be even more motivated to be the first one to do what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly and unfortunately, ambition translates negatively in politics. Gillibrand discusses how ambition might make someone look weak. Perhaps intentional and untruthful humility is better as a politician than, more accurately, ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping with the trend of discussing the differences between men and women in a professional environment — and especially in Washington — the topic of how we present ourselves and how we appear to others is a heavy one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrongfully, women are much more pressured to be thin and sexy. There are countless more diet plans and workout routines that are geared specifically for women because the media and such make it sinful to ever &lt;em&gt;let go&lt;/em&gt;. It has even been attributed to these wild and untested diets for women &lt;em&gt;aging&lt;/em&gt; faster than men — which is exactly the opposite of what anybody wants — male or female. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may come down to pure ignorance and naiveness that men on the Senate floor would approach Gillibrand and say things like, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re pretty even when you’re fat&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;Good thing you’re working out amid the pregnancy&amp;quot;. She even explains understanding where her peers may be coming from since they, say, may have never had pregnant friends on their side of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the issue of appearance even further we can look back on President Obama’s infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3214633/barack-obama-tan-suit/&quot;&gt;tan suit&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not far-fetched to assume anything he said during that conference was secondary to what he was wearing. Even Téa Leoni’s Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord of CBS’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501074/?ref_=nm_knf_i3&quot;&gt;Madam Secretary&lt;/a&gt; used her outfit and newfound style to bury a story – more press was given to her appearance than a true international crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More attention should always go to what is being said by someone rather than which hairstyle they’re sporting today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be Kind&amp;quot; ~ Kirsten Gillibrand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Work–life balance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t pretend to understand the potential struggles and certain joys of having a nuclear family while maintaining a career. The text beautifully lays out some lovely and some inconvenient instances where the work/life balance had to be carefully considered and got in the way of the senator’s agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gillibrand was in a meeting for 12 hours and skipped her dinner break to attend to a fundraiser. Tired, cramping, and in pain the entire meeting, she muddles through and manages to exit the meeting professionally and with everyone else as to not draw any attention. That night her water breaks and eventually delivers her son. Perhaps an extreme example, but one that very much stuck with me as a prime time to really consider your work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Kirsten Gillibrand’s &lt;em&gt;Off The Sidelines&lt;/em&gt; can resonate with just about anyone. Whether you’re looking for politics, discussions on gender, or even a little bit of biographical storytelling, this text will provide insight on just about anything that is relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tech Talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed giving a quick and dirty rant to the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoaconf.com/chicago-2017/home&quot;&gt;CocoaConf&lt;/a&gt; conference about mechanical keyboards and how they can help us developers master our craft. Between expressing ourselves with keyboard customization and improving our health by preventing RSI, there are so many reasons to give a lot of thought into what we&amp;#39;re slamming our fingers on for ten hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/keytalk1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Conf&quot;&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder: Review</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s third book in his &lt;em&gt;incerto&lt;/em&gt; series, &lt;em&gt;Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder&lt;/em&gt;, brings forth many philosophical ideas that I have never considered. The thesis is that things can be antifragile by having the exact opposite properties of fragile things, such as humans and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taleb illustrates the main idea of antifragility in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3REdLZ8Xis&amp;t=1496s&quot;&gt;Google talk&lt;/a&gt; where he asks the audience what the opposite of fragile is, some answers are: Robust, stout, durable, solid, and resilient. A package might say &amp;quot;Fragile: handle with care,&amp;quot; the opposite of that is, &amp;quot;Antifragile: please mishandle&amp;quot;. Antifragile things need to be shaken up and handled roughly - unlike fragile things which need a steady state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to be Antifragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest and most obvious illustration of antifragility is mankind. If a man or woman was sitting on their couch for weeks at a time without movement, they’d eventually become very unhealthy and become closer to death than their neighbor who has been working out thirty minutes a day. By inducing the stress and &lt;em&gt;mishandling&lt;/em&gt; of working out, your body becomes more powerful and gains from the disorder. Order and consistency would come from doing the same thing all the time every day, but there is no gain from that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more extreme example to drive the point could be if you go blind or get shot in the arm. The torture and disorder of enduring that pain will benefit because now you know what it feels like to get shot in the arm and other senses are heightened by losing one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar metaphor in the text explains how disastrous events like plane crashes and the sinking of the Titanic ultimately benefit. So much was learned by the sinking of the Titanic that the chances of a similar tragedy occurring again have dropped dramatically. With every plane crash that takes place, new practices are formed because we learned what not to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things that are Antifragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say if you want something done, give the task to a busy person. A busy person will already be on the roll of getting things done and taking action — they’re already antifragile by letting their disorder and constant productivity accomplish things. Being on the roll of checking off items on your todo list will only help you check more things off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taleb refers to this as overcompensation. If you’re watching a horse race where the leading stallion wins by a lap every time, the day a horse just a little better than that enters the race, the first one won’t stand a chance and will be defeated. By having the constant lack of competition the horse hasn’t gained at all and ultimately hurts its performance. However, if the two horses race more often, that overcompensation provided by the new horse will only drive the weaker horse to overcome their lack of speed and gain from it. The horse was fragile by having not having a better opponent. A better rival will always make for a better horse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;People that are Antifragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother Teresa is known to many as one of the most impactful and charitable saints in modern times. Although there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65JxnUW7Wk4&quot;&gt;great debate on whether she was good or evil&lt;/a&gt;, for the intents and purposes of this analogy we’ll assume the former. By referring to Mother Teresa as the nicest person on earth is a very fragile way of thinking. Taleb explains that to tell how good a person is they have to be given the opportunity to be bad. If you’re surrounding yourself with good, constantly performing good, and never given the chance to do evil, you may be good but also quite fragile. On the contrary, if Mother Teresa was involved in illegal and satanist activities and then decided to be good she’d have a wider good to evil ratio but also be very antifragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time ~ N.N. Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve yet to pitch a business idea to a wealthy venture capitalist, I can imagine I’d be more of a risk than a competitor who pitched the same idea with a few failed businesses under their belt. Someone who makes many errors is more antifragile than the one who hasn’t made a single one. They’re stronger and wiser so long as they haven’t made the same error multiple times to fail all their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once ~ N.N. Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Taleb, a truly fragile person is the futurist Ray Kurzweil, who, ironically, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickcalabro.com/How-to-Create-a-Mind&quot;&gt;wrote the book I just did a review on&lt;/a&gt;. Kurzweil believes in singularity and that we can all live forever. These ideas sound great but the implementation is fragile. Fragility is giving into the temptation of popping a pill when you’re ill or taking antibiotics for a minor cold. One can never be antifragile if the body is never given a chance to heal itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar trait is in the ability to be hated. By being disliked and publicly attacked, there is clearly something that the person is doing correctly to generate this anger in the first place. Can you be considered a success if you are incapable of generating envy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Software that is Antifragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great piece titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916302290&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procedia Computer Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explores an antifragile approach to software. A key ingredient to this is to be sure the software is adaptable and proactive. If a mobile development shop has made a basic app template for selling sneakers and plans to sell that same app to different shoe distributors, it’s quite fragile. The smallest change in business plan of the customer can break the deal immediately. If the development team has prepared for these changes in a way where they can easily flip a switch and turn their shoe selling app into a theatre ticket selling app, it’s much more antifragile. Antifragile software welcomes Black Swan events such as a client rebranding overnight and having their program adapt to that change in no-time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s software slogan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/facebooks-new-mantra-move-fast-with-stability/#bClteE9VcPqT&quot;&gt;Move Fast and Break Things&lt;/a&gt; is an ultimate antifragile ideology. By breaking things, embracing errors and mistakes, and mishandling the product, the software becomes stronger as a result of that. If an app has never crashed nor failed in a crucial time, there’s no preparation for that inevitable Black Swan to, perhaps, wipe the entire database during a holiday weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers must be antifragile as well. No programmer is going to learn by doing things correctly and by the book. Open mindedness is essential for any software engineer because failing will ultimately teach the wrong ways to do something - clearly this makes for a stronger developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; antifragile program would require a lot of artificial intelligence. An app that knows when something is wrong and can fix itself in minutes is surely not fragile. However, for the software to understand when a Black Swan is occurring, it either must’ve been fragile at some point or the developers must’ve been antifragile enough to program the software accordingly. Antifragile software is certainly achievable, but the antifragile business that surrounds and sells the software will always be the key ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feelings that are Antifragile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painters like painting but authors like &amp;quot;having written.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrastination is a fragile action, (or inaction). If you are writing a book, application, or manifesto, procrastinating on the task shows you are avoiding the failure it might include. Dodging the negative is as fragile as you can get. By embracing the potential failure or success makes you antifragile to it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A painter paints because they enjoy the activity and want to become more antifragile in their craft while a writer might write to gain notoriety, a much more selfish and fragile reason to do something. This will result in more antifragile paintings that are gawked at for years and fragile novels or essays that are forgotten about in weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lindy Effect shows that a book that has been in print for forty years can be expected to be in print for another forty years. If the book survives another decade it can be expected to be in print for another fifty years. This is how things in motion stay in motion. If you have $300,000 in your bank account, you’ll forever be above the poverty line just by interest alone. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thephantomoftheopera.com/&quot;&gt;The Phantom of the Opera&lt;/a&gt; can be expected to reign on Broadway for another decade since it has been the longest running musical for years and thrives off that success. Wealth will grow at a rate once it has passed a threshold just like art will once it stands the test of time. Taleb also refers to an author as antifragile in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/827498975829831681&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; because of a very large increase in sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never trust the words of a man who is not free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T.E. Lawrence, nicknamed &lt;em&gt;Lawrence of Arabia&lt;/em&gt; (titular character in one of my top three favorite movies next to the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/&quot;&gt;King Kong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/&quot;&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;) made a deal with the Arab desert tribes. The tribes eventually reneged on the agreement. Taleb believes the word of a mobster is worth more than that of a civil servant because they’re much less fragile. The honor of an individual is worth much more to that person than the honor of a nation to a servant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you do anything is how you do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fragile mindset revolves around the &lt;em&gt;halo effect&lt;/em&gt;. It assumes the skills of one field would translate perfectly to another field. If you’re a great football quarterback you can run a business. If you’re a top programmer you’d make a great significant other. A flawed way of thinking, according to Taleb, relies on how good someone might be at talking or how confident they might be regarding their ego. In reality it’s perfectly possible someone with skills in one area applying those skills to another will be extremely fragile. An entrepreneur is not measured by the conversation they hold but the product they produce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt; has opened my eyes in many ways. Reading the book twice already has not made me any more antifragile than I already was, but has taught me how to embrace my antifragility and channel it correctly. I look forward to becoming less fragile as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year I’ve become very infatuated with futurology. I’m the one in my friends group who starts fights about how we’re not going to be driving cars in five years and we’re all going to end up living life through VR. Needless to say, the idea of Artificial Intelligence plays a large role in what we can expect in our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, unlike a lot of people I encounter, am very optimistic about humanity’s future. Sure, it could end with extinction and droids taking over, but who are we to say that’s not how things were always meant to be and we’re just getting in their way? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t quite answer the questions of humanity’s fate and that’s not the intent of the piece. It does, however, give us a much better understanding of how our own bodies work and therefore helps us understand where we’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Author&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kurzweilai.net/&quot;&gt;Ray Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible source of information regarding our future. He has so much insight into what the world might look like years from now. He shares the information in many books and uses the intelligence at Google where he’s working on natural language understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why have a mind?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the main purpose of our mind? A simple question with a complicated answer. This text taught me that the neocortex’s main function is actually predicting the future. This surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple example given goes like this: We recognize letters and words. We can break down the characters into shapes that our mind will notice straight away. Apple, for example, is something we see very often — whether reading about iPhones or your local grocery store flyer. We don’t actually read the whole word, though. We see the shape of the word in its entirety and say, “oh yes, apple”. If we see just the first three letter, it might bring up visions of an icon on your phone, however. With just the first four characters, Appl, the mind predicts what is coming next. It actually predicts the future and places an ‘E’ at the end of that word to save you time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t hard to imagine how this plays out on a larger scale. A similar phenomenon is chronostasis. This doesn’t only predict the future, but also replaces the past and fills gaps in your mind. Vsauce has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNBTLbw1_2Q&quot;&gt;quality video explaining the stopped clock illusion&lt;/a&gt; where he explains how moving your eyes quickly enough can trigger your mind into inserting an image in that split second of blur. Your brain is helping you make sense of the real world but can also deceive you into thinking you saw something you did not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Memory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are chauvinistic about our brains, thinking them to be the goal of evolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that our brain’s job is to make us more intelligent. This is proved untrue given our evolution — natural selection doesn’t strive for intelligence. Your typical brain will have plenty of shortcomings including inefficient energy consumption, slow reaction time, and lengthy process of learning. It can be argued that this is not a result of crumby evolution but that humans are sufficiently evolved as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but analyzing properties of the brain can also advance other areas of science such as technology. If you are ever at a crowded bar or concert while trying to converse with someone, you may find it difficult to listen to what they are saying. However, more often than not, you’ll unintentionally block out the background noise and focus on this one person’s words. A skill that comes naturally to your mind trying to help you again is also used in cell phones when the devices attempt to block out background noise during a phone call. The audio processing that goes on in the device is the same technique that our brains use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus has the important role of remembering significant or unusual events. If a coworker arrives at the office in a silly bear costume, it will be up to the neocortex to determine that deserves a spot in the hippocampus to be remembered — unlike the daily chat you have that same coworker that might be similar to the one you had yesterday. This is one of the first areas of the brain to be damaged by Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reflex&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing tennis, watching the ball come at you at different speeds determines how late or early you’ll start your swing. If the ball is approaching quickly and you haven’t begun your move, the cerebellum will kick in and make it happen. It also helps determine where the ball might go if you swing higher, lower, softer, or with some heavy topspin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement is still widely controlled by the neocortex, but even the neocortex will fall back to the memory of the cerebellum for things you do over and over again like writing or typing. Understandably, the cerebellum is the home of muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the cerebellum is great at predicting where your tennis ball might soar, there’s a certain rush that occurs when you put yourself in a situation that can’t be predicted. Gambling releases dopamine because your cerebellum struggles to provide an outcome. Dopamine is also released when in love. Unaware of the future, fast heart rates, and loss of appetite will trigger dopamine and also kick in your fight or flight since you’re either running away or to a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lust is lewd, love is lyrical.” ~ John William Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractiveness and sex drive play a large role in initial reactions to what may become love, but evolution shows romancing then would not be necessary. Imagine a &lt;i&gt;girl (or boy) next door&lt;/i&gt; or an &lt;i&gt;office crush&lt;/i&gt;. These prospects might not be the chiseled, curvy, sexy partner you always fantasized about, but by caring about them and caring about their needs you’ll fulfil their desires just the same. There have been countless &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjnfsk7yZ2E&quot;&gt;love songs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera&quot;&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; written about this exact situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging the brain is something that provides a lot of pleasure — so much that Cecil B. Demille refers to his creativity as a drug. The mind has the potential to recognize 30 billion metaphors per second. When someone tells a joke that requires some esoteric knowledge, the cerebellum has to grab from multiple sources of your knowledge to put the pieces together and determine if it’s funny or not. Depending how specialized the joke is or how many things you needed to understand to get the entire joke can change your idea of the funniness of the joke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil only touches on dreams briefly but I had to discuss it as I’ve always felt very strongly about dreams. First, my thoughts. I don’t exactly know what it is or how humans evolved this way, but for some reason everyone &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to feel like they have an obligation to share their dreams with other people. 
The moment I’m told, “I had a crazy dream last night”, I try to end the conversation or leave as soon as possible. We all have crazy dreams. When I have a dream, crazy or not, I forget about it as quickly as I can because it provides no insights to the real world and the real things I’m trying to accomplish. The same goes for whatever conversation we’re about to have about your dream. I’ve always enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/all-dream-symbols-mean-youre-stressed-at-work-or-castration-an/&quot;&gt;House’s take on dreams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text gives some good insight into how dreams are conjured up. The big idea is that they’re simply confabulated versions of many smaller thoughts that may be lingering in our minds. As a side benefit, there are no real-world phenomena that constraint abilities in a dream. So, you’re never distracted by how easily you tore off your arm and used it to slap your friends around. You just enjoy the slapping as it’s happening in the dream. Same goes for that bronze elephant jumping through the window. You take your dream at face value without any regard to feasibility. The real innovation is that by ignoring common laws we’re used to now, things can get much more efficient. I’d love to have a dream one night where Albert Einstein and Jesus Christ visited me and gave me personal one-on-ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mind vs. Computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I’m after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. ~ Alan Turing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lisp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil refers to Lisp as the dominant programming language for AI related projects. Although the creator of Lisp (LISt Processor), John McCarthy, coined the term “artificial intelligence” (AI), there is a lot of debate over the best language — another popular one is Prolog. Jumping to the conclusion here is slightly uncomfortable because Lisp is directly compared to our neocortex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, each pattern recognizer in the neocortex can be regarded as a LISP statement — each one constitutes a list of elements, and each element can be another list. The neocortex is therefore indeed engaged in list processing of a symbolic nature very similar to that which takes place in a LISP program. Moreover, it processes all 300 million LISP-like “statements” simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique Watson uses to win Jeopardy is essentially the same exact thing humans would do. It parses through all the keywords in the initial question and compares it to its 15 TB archive of human knowledge until it finds something it can confidently conclude to be the answer. The debate over whether or not this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; artificial intelligence is interesting. Ultimately, Watson is doing what a human would do — that is good enough for some people. Noam Chomsky was unimpressed by Watson by stating that it is no more special than Deep Blue, the Chess computer that defeated Garry Kasparov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson understands nothing. It’s a bigger steamroller. Actually, I work in AI, and a lot of what is done impresses me, but not these devices to sell computers. ~ &lt;a href=&quot;http://framingbusiness.net/archives/1287&quot;&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has commented on Chomsky’s remarks by saying it’s one of the most impressive things we have seen in this field so far and as long as there are flaws there will be naysayers. At the end of the day, it comes down to how easily impressed you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the clearest demonstration I’ve seen of computers handling the subtleties of language including metaphors, puns and jokes, something people had said would not be possible. I don’t agree with Chomsky that Watson is not impressive in that regard. As long as AI has any flaws or limitations, people will jump on these. By the time that the set of these limitations is nil, AI will have long since surpassed unaided human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed&lt;/i&gt; has enlightened me in many ways. 
It’s crucial to understand the mind in order to break the barriers of science and technology. By understanding the hippocampus’ job and knowing its failure is the first step in a widespread disease, we’re able to pinpoint what needs to be fixed and can more easily develop an implant to resolve or mitigate the damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand a computer you should learn how to code and to be a better driver you should take apart the engine. There’s a lower level to everything that must be understood to accomplish any innovation. Although I haven’t learned enough to build a mind myself, I feel accomplished enough to notice what’s going on up there when I recall a novel idea or catch a baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Book Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a Whitefox&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has always been infatuated with the startup community, tech companies, and entrepreneurship as a whole, I decided it was finally time to give &lt;i&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/i&gt; a serious read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I was first exposed to this world by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pmarca&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. A single Twitter account might seem like too small of a platform to skyrocket an entire passion, but it did. Reading Andreessen’s constant insights and witticisms on VC culture and tech got me more and more interested in being involved in it myself. Eventually digging down the rabbit whole led me to learn about the wider scope of it all including his business parter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bhorowitz&quot;&gt;Ben Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;. When I saw Horowitz had written a book on everything I wanted to learn more about, I knew it was a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really know what to expect from this book; I figured it was going to be a walkthrough of how Horowitz and Andreessen met and eventually created &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/a16z&quot;&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt; — and it had some of that. What I wasn’t expecting was a nearly explicit tutorial on how to start and manage a company. It turned out to be a really great goldmine and reference to all the nuances building a business might entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Just Win, Baby&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning chapters of &lt;i&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/i&gt; explains how Ben Horowitz met Marc Andreessen and takes us through some of the early days of his career when he was running Loudcloud and Opsware. If nothing else, Ben’s story makes you extremely sure he’s more than qualified to be telling us how to run a company since he’s taken failing companies and turned them into success stories with higher stock prices when he’s through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll refrain from going into too much detail on the biography side of things as I find the core of the text to be in the following chapters, but the ultimate idea is that Opsware IPO’d at $6, fell all the way to $0.35, and rose to $14.25 by the time it was sold to HP. With those numbers alone, it’s clear management was top-notch at the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text quickly gets in to more logistical aspects of companies. Being interested in productivity, systems, and such, the book started really heating up for me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of discussion on what makes a good place to work. What draws people to your company? What keeps them there? An important thing to keep in the minds of employees is the big picture. Everyone should know exactly what their roles are and how it impacts the company. The idea is to be sure employees feel accomplished for themselves and that they have made a contribution to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me break it down for you. In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally. It is a true pleasure to work in an organization such as this. Every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective, and make a difference for the organization and themselves. These things make their jobs both motivating and fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping employees is more directed toward the trajectory of the actual company. People are much more likely to stay at company that is booming and all their friends are using than one that is actively laying people off and making headlines about shrinking stock prices. Being sure the company isn’t failing and doesn’t meet these negative criteria is the #1 method to keeping a quality staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training plays a large part in your business as well. Defining the role, organizing tasks, and being certain everyone knows exactly what they’re doing will make or break the productivity of the office. Horowitz even expresses frustration when employees at Netscape were unsure of their jobs due to lack of training — specifically the product managers. There are many guidelines set out for product managers in the text as well. Good product managers value discipline, are not told what to do, ask quality questions, decompose problems properly, and ultimately know good products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Big Company Execs vs. Small Company Execs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time will eventually come when the board of a company suggests hiring some high-level executive with outstanding résumés to really kick the business into high-gear. The problem is that a Marketing Director from, say, Coca-Cola, has a very different role than the Marketing Director at your 2-year old tech startup. One of the key differences is simply behavioral. The Big Company Exec will be conditioned to wait for emails, phone calls, and make important decisions. These are valuable skills that require experience and will help immensely in a large company, but building a company is very different than running an already established company — this is also why, for example, Steve Jobs was a fine CEO at Apple, Inc. only after a few more CEO-like people took care of the role before him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone motivated by equity looking to get in on a small company is someone you do not want on your team. Any percent of zero is still zero. The biggest reason to get in on a small and growing company is to wear different hats, be creative, and build something from nothing with a great team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bad Employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/i&gt; has some great scenarios regarding bad employees. Firstly, it is said hiring is one of the most important and difficult jobs while building a company. Deciding who is a good cultural fit and who exhibits the right (or wrong) characteristics is impossible to decipher in just a few interviews. It is recommended to jot down exactly which skills are necessary for the role, and which weaknesses can be tolerated; this will make for a fine guideline on who can assume the roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text gives three examples of poor employees: &lt;b&gt;The Heretic&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;The Flake&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;The Jerk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;The Heretic&lt;/b&gt; is usually very smart and has a way of making people listen to them. Their primary goal is to convince everyone the company is doomed and run poorly. &lt;b&gt;The Flake&lt;/b&gt; can come in different shapes and sizes. The text’s example has a prodigy genius programmer who learned an entire codebase in half the time they would’ve expected and churned out some of the cleanest code they have ever seen. The prodigy soon changed and missed days at a time, then weeks without calling in. Long story short, he was addicted to cocaine. &lt;b&gt;The Jerk&lt;/b&gt; is more harmful than the former two. This employee (or executive) will take opportunities to shoot down ideas, give snarky remarks, and just be unpleasant. More than being a poor cultural fit, the danger lies in ideas being suppressed in fear of The Jerk retaliating with a morale-killing remark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFL Coach John Madden once stated that he would &lt;i&gt;hold&lt;/i&gt; the bus for a player like Terrell Owens. Owens was an exceptional player in that he was extremely good and a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keeping Calm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the road, not the wall. The text explains the old driving adage applies to life and running companies as well. When you look at the wall which represents death, crash, and failure, you’re focusing on the wrong thing. Look ahead at the road to where you’re going and what you’re going to accomplish and the wall may as well not even be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text says a CEO being born is as wild an idea as a Jolly Rancher being grown from a plant. CEO is an unnatural job that can only come with experience and doing it. A quality CEO’s job is to actually master the unnatural. It’s part of the process to feel incompetent and that you won’t be able to run your company in one year, or even fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had known more about what the book was about I might not have read it yet. However, I’m glad I read it now and I think it’s valuable for anyone working in a company that consists of more than three people. &lt;i&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/i&gt; is a great tutorial for how to run a company — That doesn’t mean that it’s not valuable information for anyone working at a company, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway for me is: Although we have a great resource for conquering the hard things, everything will eventually go wrong, you will want to quit at multiple stages, and almost everything is going to have be figured out on the fly. That is quite literally the primary role of an executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the hard thing about hard things is that there are no answers and it all boils down to hard work, difficult decisions, and quality management. While reading this book, lessons were learned that I have already implemented in my day-to-day life. My excitement towards becoming a CEO has only grown thanks to &lt;i&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>TEX Yoda Build Log &amp; Review</title>

   <updated>2016-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;TEX Yoda Build Log &amp;amp; Review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Board&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tex Yoda is a somewhat coveted board in &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://geekhack.org/&quot;&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://deskthority.net/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;. Its limited availability and heavy price tag make it very rare. However, this keyboard has some very unique features along with high-quality parts to make it all worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/yoda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TEX Yoda Keyboard from Massdrop.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable thing that distinguishes this keyboard from most others is that red dot you see right in the center. This will undoubtedly bring back memories of some old laptops that came with a TrackPoint as well. It’s simply an attachment that allows you to control the mouse movements without the need to reach all the way over to your mouse. Some refer to this as a pointing stick - I like TrackPoint as that’s how IBM wants it; some have a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/243/&quot;&gt;appropriate term&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yoda also features a full aluminum body. This is great as it adds a fair amount of sturdiness to the board and it feels great; although it is very heavy. It’s a standard 60% layout with a few extra keys to act as the mouse clicks and for scrolling. Since these are normally DIY, you get the option of whichever switches you’d like. I chose Cherry MX Clears as they were all the rage when I picked this up. Although I’m not the biggest fan of Clears (I prefer Zealios over Clears, Greens over Zealios, Topre over Greens, and Buckling Springs over everything - but this is a discussion for another blog post), typing on this was still an amazing experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout, though not incredibly special as it’s almost exactly what you’d get with a Pok3r, is innovative and efficient. Firstly, the reason you’d be excited for a TrackPoint is to keep your hands on the home row without wasting time moving to the mouse. It takes some getting used to, but it’s a very natural habit once you learn exactly where to place your fingers. I’ve also never had any problems clicking with the bottom three keys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tex Yoda Layout&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never used a 60%, this is a great one to do some learning on. Although the Yoda isn’t fully programmable it offers some unique shortcuts I haven’t found on any other boards. You’ve got standard media keys, home, page-up/page-down, and even scroll-up/scroll-down all in the function layer. It also has the arrow keys in the WASD &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; IJKL positions unlike the Poker II which has them in the WASD position and the Pok3r which has them in the IJKL. Options are nice and it’s actually the reason I have little use for the Pok3r over the Poker II, (although, nothing beats the &lt;code&gt;[;’/&lt;/code&gt; arrow keys as featured on the HHKB). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve built a few keyboards in my day so I didn’t feel worried about messing up this expensive board. Building keyboards is usually a very straightforward process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solder diodes onto the PCB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install switches onto the plate (if the board is plate-mounted as opposed to PCB-mounted, which this one is)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line up plate &amp;amp; switches onto the PCB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solder each switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solder the chip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install drivers, create and upload firmware, or whatever the situation might be for your particular board. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/parts.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Included parts of the Tex Yoda Keyboard&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/parts1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Tex Yoda circuit board&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/parts3.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Tex Yoda circuit board and plate&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/parts5.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Tex Yoda controller&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yoda came with the case, two PCBs, a plate, some wires, an attachment for the underside of the case, screws, and some other boring stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/switches.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Tex Yoda and cherry mx clear switches&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After monotonously snapping each switch in their proper spot, flip it over, be sure all the switch’s pins are straight, and align the PCB so it falls onto each switch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/upsidedown.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cherry MX Clear Switches applied onto the TEX Yoda plate&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/wpcb.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cherry MX Clear Switches applied onto the TEX Yoda plate with the circuit board placed on top&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot solder and take pictures simultaneously but if you look closely you can see each soldered switch. Next, alight the TrackPoint in the case and place the PCB over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/soldered.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Soldered Cherry switches onto the TEX Yoda circuit board&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/trackalign.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;TEX Yoda circuit board inside the case&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, add your keycaps and TrackPoint and enjoy your new keyboard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/Tex/complete.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;TEX Yoda and HHKB Type-S&quot;&gt;

   <title>Reflections and Review of Rework</title>

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@NickCalabs&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Reflections and Review of Rework&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with an IBM Model M SSK&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt;, everyone does. I, unfortunately, haven’t even had the pleasure of using their software since nowhere I’ve worked has ever made it their tool for communication and productivity. The great thing about Basecamp is that you don’t need to use its products to enjoy its methodologies and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of myself as a very productive and extremely efficient person. I’ve sometimes spent hours creating keyboard shortcuts or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; workflows that might only save me three or four seconds at a time. In a few years, however, that will add up to saving me hours if I use these shortcuts enough — which I do, and will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an avid reader of Basecamp’s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/&quot;&gt;Signal vs. Noise&lt;/a&gt;. I feel enlightened and motivated every time I get to peek inside the mind of someone who’s involved in one of the best companies. I sometimes feel inefficient after reading a post, however. Being a student and working part time as a web developer is bound to sound inefficient yet productive right away — commuting, juggling between schoolwork and personal side-projects, work, it’s a mess. But, you don’t realize how much better things can operate if only you took the time to rethink your strategies. That is exactly what &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; helps you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Basecamp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basecamp, previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37 Signals&lt;/a&gt;, has brought the world a few different products. I have been lucky enough to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh&quot;&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt;’s Ruby on Rails quite extensively. In the opening pages of &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt;, we’re told exactly what Basecamp is — a small company. This is a key to their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard horror stories about how difficult it is to get in the doors of Basecamp; how resumes are just thrown away (because they’re ridiculous), how you’re shunned if you wear a suit and can’t pull it off properly. Though, once you’re in the mindset of how they operate, all these things seem reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a small company does not mean you’re a &lt;i&gt;small&lt;/i&gt; company. A great example from the book compares big companies hiring people left and right and how this makes them seem more successful while top universities stay the same size while &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; hiring professors left and right and they’re still considered the top universities. Surely, it’s not the quantity but the quality of your staff. Basecamp is very sure to keep its people at that very high quality with the culture and &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/employee-benefits-at-basecamp-d2d46fd06c58#.lei2g68jf&quot;&gt;employee benefits&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Working Hard or Working Smart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonfried&quot;&gt;Jason Fried&lt;/a&gt; and everyone at Basecamp are very passionate about the amount of time they work. They lay out examples of these people who spend all day at the office and work because they’re practically addicted to it. The worst part is that these same people could be getting all their work done in a reasonable amount of time, but don’t always know the most efficient method because they’re blinded by the current task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making a Difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things for me is that I’m making an impact on something and someone. I worked at Verizon over one summer, and at first I didn’t feel like I was doing much. “Oh Verizon.com doesn’t have my picture on it with a link to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nickcalabs&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. What’s the point!?” This is selfish and although an intern doesn’t have too much impact on the whole company, what I did mattered. I hope to make even more of an impact at the next place I decide to work. Basecamp would make sure of this, even before hiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This makes my life better.” — Customer after using your product (via Rework)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have billion dollar app ideas. I have about twenty a day. Of course, &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; tells us what we already knew when saying having an idea is useless unless you act on it. I’m pretty sure I had the idea of a social blogging platform a few years ago, that doesn’t mean I would’ve created &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I thought up a great app to help keep track of the books I’m reading. It would download the cover art automatically, it could keep track of the page I’m on, I could sync it to a back-end so I can always keep track no matter the device I’m on — it would be an awesome app. I did some digging to find a few book tracking apps and I downloaded a few. Most of them were good, some did some of what I wanted while others did the rest. Surely, it’d be a waste to make my own since it basically already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; teaches to scratch our own itch. Software development is here for us to solve our own problems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3843-do-you-have-to-love-what-you-do&quot;&gt;Even if you don’t like coding&lt;/a&gt;, you might be obligated to make an app that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; need. I’m currently working on that very reading app that I hope will solve all my troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building a Startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dream of one day building a startup. I like to think I have the chops to do it and do it right. Startups are glamorous and sexy. Ping Pong tables, beer on tap, free food — there’s nothing like the startup environment. &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; explains that the startup buzzword is really just that — a buzzword. Businesses are what matter and starting a business is what you’re really trying to do. DHH explains in &lt;a href=&quot;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider&quot;&gt;RECONSIDER&lt;/a&gt; how all these companies try to take over the world while Basecamp is happy with the revenue they have and the products they launch. This is an admirable mentality and really shines light on the idea that I can start a business right now and be successful without being the next Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; also jabs at the popular exit strategy. I once attended a &lt;a href=&quot;http://3daystartup.org/&quot;&gt;3 Day Startup&lt;/a&gt;, we had a pretty good idea, a nice product, and dreams of turning it in to something. That hope still exists, of course. One of the members on our team mentioned an exit strategy, “If we get enough users we can definitely get someone to buy us out”. Even I, someone with barely any startup experience, was confused by this. Why worry about that now? Live in the moment with your business and do what is right at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building what you can&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agile&lt;/i&gt; is another popular buzzword; break things fast and early. This is pretty true and the book teaches that building something half-assed is much worse than building half a product. I was once redesigning a website for a nonprofit. The client knew what he wanted, right down to the pixel and it turns out he wanted an exact replica of another popular company; this was difficult but doable. Once it was finally finished and ready for launch, that company completely rebranded and changed the website; we had to, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Build half a product, not a half-assed product”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to read &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; to understand how inefficient this is but it did help me understand how inefficient it was having to implement an entire blog before we launch. The web is a place for iteration. The site was perfectly designed and ready for the people’s eyes. A blog will be great after a little work, but not crucial to the entire launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very enjoyable, motivational, inspiring, and easy read. Sometimes I get so caught up in my workflow and my productivity apps I forget about what I’m trying to be productive for. &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; was able to fill my need for learning about the system but still teach me about the bigger picture as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many examples and comparisons to big companies we see every day. I was able to stay very engaged the entire time and I never really wanted to put the book down. In fact, I got through the entire thing in only two sittings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffer from Imposter Syndrome quite a lot. I don’t have many software developer friends and I currently work at a company as the only person who understands what the internet is. Many of the examples in &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; are going to stick with me for a while as I think about how I want to spend the rest of my professional career and how I overcome these things that might simply be in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I found &lt;i&gt;Rework&lt;/i&gt; very relatable so I apologize if you weren’t expecting so many of my personal stories. I trust they added something to this write-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;The following was typed with a HHKB&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sports have great rivalries. Currently in the NFL, two elite quarterbacks and two of the best men to ever play the game are best friends and yet worst enemies. They play each other nearly every year and it wasn’t until many years that Manning’s Colts were able to come out on top over Brady’s Patriots. The rivalry between the two has helped them become better players. Because of this, some wonder if they would be as elite had it not been for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peyton Manning’s story starts with his father and then the University of Tennessee. Archie Manning was drafted by the Saints in 1971 and stuck around for ten years. At this time, however, the Saints’ fans wore paper bags on their heads and referred to their team as “the Aints”. Peyton and Cooper would attend the games with their mother until it became too much of a strain for her while pregnant with Eli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peyton eventually became heavily interested in the sport. He and older brother Cooper played in the yard with their dad. Soon, the Manning brothers owned their high school. During Cooper’s senior year as a wide receiver, Peyton became starting quarterback. Just as Cooper is getting ready to go to Ole Miss, he’s diagnosed with spinal stenosis and his football career is over. To this day Peyton honors him by wearing his number: 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/07/sports/sp-29900&quot;&gt;1997 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; against the UCLA Bruins it was Manning’s first time going into a huddle as the Tennessee QB. They were down by 21 so he tries to pump up his teammates with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shZ4vf1Anq4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m1s&quot;&gt;pep talk&lt;/a&gt;. Peyton was a freshman while the rest of the team were mostly seniors. 330 lb Left Tackle grabs him and says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, freshman, shut the **** up and call the ****ing play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then on Peyton Manning started every game until eleven years into his NFL career. He was eventually drafted in 1998 by the Indianapolis Colts and played his first professional game against his biggest idol, Dan Marino. The Miami Dolphins came out on top &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199809060clt.htm&quot;&gt;defeating The Colts 24–15&lt;/a&gt; with Marino passing for 135 yards and Karim Abdul-Jabbar rushing for 108.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Brady&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Brady struggled at Michigan. Head coach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Carr&quot;&gt;Lloyd Carr&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t make it easy for him to play QB. Game after game went on until he decided to do something about it and confront his coach. He told Carr he may transfer because he doesn’t see himself being able to get on the field and feels it’s unfair. Carr, ready to release Brady as he doesn’t want a pouter on his team, tells Tom something we can see has stuck with him to this day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, you want to be the best, you’ve got to stick it out and try to beat out the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this, Brady walked in to practice every day with his A-game, got up early to train, and did his best to be the best — just like he still does walking into practice on the Patriots. Carr said Brady enjoyed the struggle. It changed him and helped him be the competitive player he is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To toy with his players even more, Carr eventually had a plan to decide who would be the starting quarterback. He’d put Brady in one quarter, Henson in the second quarter, and decided from there who gets the play the second half. Tom won some and lost some. Tom’s father was upset at the lack of play-time his son had at Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brady got his start in the NFL once the Pats lost both games opening the season to both the Bengles and the Jets. Drew Bledsoe was out due to injury and Brady was in. Tom was a sixth-round pick and already knew what it was like not being on the field from Michigan. With what he learned there, he eventually came out on top and started on the Patriots under Bill Belichick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nearly Jets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Leaf was one of the most impressive quarterbacks coming out of college in time for the 1998 draft. He nearly won the Heisman Trophy coming third behind Peyton and Charles Woodson who won it. Meanwhile, the Colts were deciding between Leaf and Manning for their QB. Both were good — Leaf was probably better. But Manning was a safer choice and more of a franchise quarterback. Bill Polian decides on Manning while Leaf is picked up by the San Diego Chargers. Leaf soon shows bad behavior, he’s not performing well, and after an injury he’s history. Leaf is widely referred to as the biggest draft bust in NFL history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I got to be a senior in college. It’s not a year you can ever get back. There was no guarantee the Jets were even going to draft me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a short while before this and before Manning really finished college, the NY Jets showed interest in drafting him while he was still at Tennessee. The NFL doesn’t like these types of deals and discourages it, but nothing about it was against the rules. He did graduate, but with a year of eligibility left to play. Manning had a decision to make, he could’ve played with the Jets for the next fifteen years but he also wanted to play as a senior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a select few players get invited to attend the draft. If you’re guaranteed a spot, you have to be there for pictures and such. Manning was at his draft. Brady was sitting on his couch watching it on TV with his family. Rounds went by and Brady wasn’t mentioned once. Finally in the sixth round, the Patriots selected Brady with the 199th overall pick. This was also the draft where Sebastian Janikowski became the first placekicker since 1966 to be selected in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jets had a better chance picking up a future elite QB in 2000 when Bill Parcells was told Brady would be a wise decision for their sixth round pick. Tony Scott, North Carolina safety, ended up being drafted and played for only 23 games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stats and Rings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing the numbers game is difficult with these two and some would argue it’s not even fair. The best quarterback can mean different things to different people. In 2004, Manning broke Dan Marino’s record of most touchdown passes in a single season at 49. Come the final game of the 2007 season against the Giants, Brady connected with Randy Moss twice to beat Peyton’s record at 50 while Moss broke Jerry Rice’s record of most receiving touchdowns in a season at 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peyton had called Eli before this game asking, if possible, to keep Brady from passing any TDs so he can hold his record for more than just a few years. His gift to the Giant’s defense would have been a night out at the famous New York City steakhouse, &lt;a href=&quot;http://delfriscos.com/&quot;&gt;Del Frisco’s&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, now on the Broncos, Manning was able to beat Brady’s record and be sure he kept it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_single_season.htm&quot;&gt;55 touchdowns&lt;/a&gt; in a single season. Recently, Manning also took the lead for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm&quot;&gt;most career touchdowns&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind, he has two years in the NFL more than Brady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brady has taken the Patriots to the Super Bowl six times, winning four and being named the MVP three times. This is impressive, especially compared to Manning, who has only been to the Super Bowl three times winning just once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surrounding Talent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had Brady been picked up by the Jets or any other team he would not be the Tom Brady we know today. Belichick plus Brady is simply one of the greatest duos in NFL history. The Patriots have also had great teams each time they went to the Super Bowl, but one thing to keep in mind is this is an elite quarterback. The idea that Brady and Belichick with any other team winning is not far fetched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manning is one of three quarterbacks to take two teams to the Super Bowl. An example of his best game and one of the greatest comebacks ever is the 2006 season AFC championship against the Patriots, of course. Down 18 points at 21–3, Manning would have to lead the biggest comeback in conference championship history. They managed to tie it multiple times until finally taking the lead with seconds left on the clock. Indianapolis went on to beat the Bears in the Super Bowl two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brady vs. Manning&lt;/i&gt; was an enjoyable read. Gary Myers does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat reading about a game that happened nearly a decade ago and that you know the outcome of. There is a lot to be learned about the sport of football and the politics of the NFL. I think it was all laid out in such a way that was coherent enough for even someone who doesn’t know much about the sport to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’re a lot of details to every story. Some things are more relevant than others and the lives of Brady &amp;amp; Manning had a lot of fun facts. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brady and Gisele sold their house to Dr. Dre for $40 million in 2014 at 4x their original investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Sanchez was the first QB to beat Manning and Brady back-to-back in the playoffs in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;

And finally:

&lt;li&gt;Brady has 11 wins while Manning has 5 against each other. Brady has 32 TDs and 14 INTs against Manning while he has 33 TDs and 22 INTs. They’re tied at two playoff wins each as of January 23 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the Brady-Manning rivalry. The text gives some deep insights into what makes each player better and worse. One thing that deserves its own post is Spygate and Deflategate. Though the scandals accusing the Patriots of cheating might be more of an internal problem, it changes the outcome of a lot and some of it might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:title&quot; content=&quot;Recreating A Graph With D3js&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://teamtreehouse.com&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; years ago with hopes I could supplement my college education with some web development. It wasn’t long until I was taking on tasks at work relating to the website and soon considering myself a real developer. One thing I always loved about the site was the design and colors. View it in real life along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/nickcalabro&quot;&gt;my Treehouse profile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/nickcalabro&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCalabs/nickcalabs.github.io/master/img/tree.png&quot; alt=&quot;Treehouse progress page with chart example&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data visualization is interesting here. Made with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highcharts.com/&quot;&gt; Highcharts&lt;/a&gt;, the color coordination and legend make it fairly easy to read how much you’ve learned at a glance. This works better than a bar graph because it is dynamic to 100% of everything you’ve learned and changes in proportion to how much of each category you’ve studied. The only confusing thing here are the points system which seem arbitrary at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like this can be easily done with &lt;a href=&quot;http://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;. First, get the skeleton of your site ready, import D3 and create a single divthis will be the only markup for the entire visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Script Tag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the magic occurs in the script. First we create our data with a simple array. Defending the colors early is important as well. The initial r variable is the radius that defines the whole svg. The canvas and group vars are also for sizing and placement on the webpage. innerRadius and outerRadius being different are what give our graph the pie shape with the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choosing Colors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful when coloring your visualization. D3 has some functions that will color your graph with 10, 20, 30 and more color combinations. This can be tricky once you have more than ten slices of your pie, though. One set after the other might have an identical color with a different opacity; this might lead a viewer to believe the two values are related when really they could have nothing to do with each other. This happens once you use &lt;code&gt;d3.scale.category20()&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, you could choose all your own colors with &lt;code&gt;d3.scale.ordinal() .range([‘red’, ‘blue’, #E55D63]);&lt;/code&gt; and however many you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCalabs/nickcalabs.github.io/master/img/category10.png&quot; alt=&quot;pie chart using catergory10&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
category10()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCalabs/nickcalabs.github.io/master/img/category20.png&quot; alt=&quot;pie chart using catergory20&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
category20()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCalabs/nickcalabs.github.io/master/img/ordinal.png&quot; alt=&quot;pie chart using ordinal&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
ordinal() .range([&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more you can do with D3. I’ll follow this up with another post on how to make it more interactive. I’d like a tooltip to appear on hover and have the legend interact with hovering as well. It can be seen live here. Thanks for your time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:description&quot; content=&quot;Nick Calabro's Blog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;This is one large post covering, in detail, how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://nameless-dusk-8821.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;create this blog with Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; from backend to frontend. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rails New&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website you are on right now is a fairly basic blog written in Ruby on Rails. It allows users to create posts and involves some pretty exciting syntax highlighting and Bootstrap integration. In a series of articles, I will go through, step by step, how to create this very site - from rails new all the way to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is designed for someone who is comfortable with code in general, however, I’ll be doing my best to describe what each step does and why we’re doing it. Hopefully, you and I will learn more about the intricacies of a site like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we have to open up Terminal. Navigate to the directory you’d like this project to live in and create a new Rails app. In this case I’ll be going to the Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;cd Desktop
rails new blog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see everything being created in the terminal. Now, enter the blog directory and start the Rails server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;cd blog
rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt;. You should see this screen letting you know everything is running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/railswelcome.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Git Init&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up your project in your favorite text editor. You should see a whole file tree including app, bin, config, and whatnot. We’re going to touch nearly everything here so be patient. While we’re here, now might be a good time to create our git repository. In your terminal, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;git init
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to create the repository. Then, with status we can see all the untracked files in red. Add the entire directory, check the status again, and commit it all with a little message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we need to add some functionality to our app. First we need to create a controller for our posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;rails generate controller posts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see your terminal spit out some stuff after this one. To see what the generate did, navigate to &lt;code&gt;app/controllers/&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll find the &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; was born. We’re going to want the posts to be at the root of our site and we need there to be some functionality to create a new post. The first step for this is to give it the index and the new actions. Here’s your &lt;code&gt;posts_controller&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;PostsController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the routes file (&lt;code&gt;config/routes.rb&lt;/code&gt;). We can start by deleting all the comments in this file. It’s very cluttered and can be daunting. At this point, you should be left with only two lines. Inside, you’re going to add some routes. We need a route for our posts, and we also want that posts page to be our root. At the end, your &lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt; should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:posts&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;posts#index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, if you refresh your browser (be sure your server is still running [rails s]) you’ll find an error telling you you’re missing a template. To fix this, head over to &lt;code&gt;app/views/posts/&lt;/code&gt; and add a new file called &lt;code&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. In this file, feel free to add some dummy HTML and just make sure it shows up in your browser. We also have the new action to worry about. Create another file inside &lt;code&gt;app/views/posts/&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;new.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. Now, if we navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/posts/new&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll get that file. In your &lt;code&gt;new.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; file, we’ll need a form to actually let the user create a post with. It’ll look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= form_for :post, url: posts_path do |f| %&amp;gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= f.label :title %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= f.text_field :title %&amp;gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= f.label :body %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= f.text_area :body %&amp;gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= f.submit %&amp;gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/posts/new&lt;/code&gt; and enjoy the view of the wonderfully boring form you just created. Now, if you hit submit on this page, your data isn’t going to really go anywhere. The next step is to generate a model. Head over to your terminal and repeat after me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;rails g model Post title:string body:text
rake db:migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see under &lt;code&gt;db/migrate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;app/models&lt;/code&gt; the newest files just created. In &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; we’re going to create our create method and our private method to permit the parameters. We’re also going to add the show method for when we want to display an individual post. &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;PostsController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;post_params&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we create a post, we have to create the show page. Again, under &lt;code&gt;app/views/posts&lt;/code&gt;, create a new file called &lt;code&gt;show.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. Here, we’re going to want to display the title and body of our posts. Also, I threw in some interesting code to get the date of the post to show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= @post.title %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Submitted &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= time_ago_in_words(@post.created_at) %&amp;gt; ago&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= @post.body %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/posts/new&lt;/code&gt;, create your post, and navigate to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/posts/1&lt;/code&gt;, you should see your first ever blog post. The final step for now is to be sure we can access all the posts currently in our database. In &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;, inside the index action add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in &lt;code&gt;index.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; we need to create a loop to display all our posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% @posts.each &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= link_to post.title, post %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%B, %d, %Y&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and commit have you have with git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Styling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app has very little functionality - which is good. At least it has some functionality. Before we continue, though, I think we should add some styling so we’re not looking at any gross basic HTML structuring. The first thing we’re going to do here is add Bootstrap. In your terminal, create a new branch. This way, if we screw something up, we can always revert back to where we are now and start breathing at a normal rate again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;git co -b style
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;co&lt;/code&gt; is checkout, &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut to switch directly to that branch, and &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the branch. Now if you enter &lt;code&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll see the master branch, and that we’re on the style branch. Now since we’re safe, let’s get stylish. In your Gemfile, near the middle, before the &lt;code&gt;group :development, :test do&lt;/code&gt;, add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'therubyracer'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'less-rails'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'twitter-bootstrap-rails'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'~&amp;gt; 3.2.1.rc1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow along with how I went about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails&quot;&gt;Twitter Bootstrap Rails&lt;/a&gt; github repo, by the way. Now give your terminal a little &lt;code&gt;rails g bootstrap:install less&lt;/code&gt;; this will install the proper stylesheets and whatnot. Then, &lt;code&gt;rails g bootstrap:layout&lt;/code&gt; will create the &lt;code&gt;application.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. It’ll probably ask you if you’re sure you want to overwrite your current file, just confirm that you do. Now if you reload your browser you’ll see a much more pleasing site - still showing our posts, and now with a sidebar as well. For the site you’re currently viewing, I got rid of the sidebar. I’m sure you can figure out how to cut that out, if not, here’s the snippet to delete. You can even play around with some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;’s features and make an even cooler sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;col-lg-3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;well sidebar-nav&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sidebar&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;nav nav-list&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;nav-header&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sidebar&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Link1&quot;, &quot;/path1&quot;  %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Link2&quot;, &quot;/path2&quot;  %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Link3&quot;, &quot;/path3&quot;  %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--/.well --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--/span--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Navbar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of making what we have a little more presentable and to give us some instant gratification we’re going to add some Bootstrap markup to this. Right now, we see Bootstrap generated a nice nav bar for us. It’s cute, but it’s not what I have here, and we’re building this very site. To achieve the transparent nav with links floating on the right while maintaining a nice dropdown toggle for mobile I had to do a few things. First fix your &lt;code&gt;navbar-brand&lt;/code&gt;, because that’s probably not how you want that displayed. I did it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Nick Calabro&quot;, root_path, class: &quot;navbar-brand&quot; %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, we’re able to put it in an &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; tag, and it’s also still a link with the bootstrap class &lt;code&gt;navbar-brand&lt;/code&gt; that keeps it in place. There are also some divs we want to throw in there, and we’re going to do some magic to get links to active or not if you’re on the corresponding page. When it’s all said and done, it’ll look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;navbar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;container&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;navbar-header page-scroll&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;navbar-toggle&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-toggle=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;collapse&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;.navbar-responsive-collapse&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon-bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon-bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;icon-bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Nick Calabro&quot;, root_path, class: &quot;navbar-brand&quot; %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;navbar-collapse collapse navbar-responsive-collapse&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;nav navbar-nav navbar-right&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;%= 'active' if current_page?(root_path) %&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;%= link_to &quot;Articles&quot;, root_path  %&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;, we’re embedding some ruby to only add the active class if the current page is that &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt;’s path. Pretty cool, if you ask me - right, you didn’t ask me. Another way we could’ve done this looks something like this &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;%= &amp;#39;active&amp;#39; if params[:controller] == &amp;#39;root&amp;#39; %&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%= link_to “Articles&amp;quot;, root_path  %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. On to terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;git add status
git add .
git commit -m “Add Bootstrap&quot;

git co master
git merge style
git branch -d style
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have something that looks pretty, we can commit these changes, merge them, delete the style branch and add some crazy functionality next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Validate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, you can create a post with absolutely no content inside. In your &lt;code&gt;app/models/post.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, we’re going to want to add some validations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;presence: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;length: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;miniimum: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;presence: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll look like this when you’re finished. It can be kind of self-explanatory, but all we’re doing it telling it to throw an error if the title isn’t present at all or has fewer than 5 characters. Same thing with the body minus the char count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have to add some functionality to &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;. In the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; method add &lt;code&gt;@post = Post.new&lt;/code&gt;. We’re also going to change up the create method by adding a little conditional. It should look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'new'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Errors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you try to make a post at &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/posts/new&lt;/code&gt; and your title is not at least five characters, you won’t be able to post it. But, this isn’t very intuitive. Sure, you know about that rule now, but you might forget. A simple error message can really come in handy. So, near the form in &lt;code&gt;new.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; add this right under the &lt;code&gt;form_for&lt;/code&gt; and right before the first &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;any?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div id=&quot;error&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= pluralize(@post.errors.count, &quot;error&quot;) %&amp;gt; prevented this post from saving&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;% @post.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% end &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re here, cut everything from this file except the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; tag on top and create a new file in the same directory called &lt;code&gt;_form.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. This is a special type of file called a partial that’ll allow you to throw snippets like the form into. These types of coding practices will help keep our programs more DRY. Paste the whole form in there and just change the first line from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= form_for :post, url: posts_path do |f| %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= form_for @post do |f| %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - this will ensure our form is dynamic enough to be passed around the application. Now in &lt;code&gt;new.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; just add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%= render ‘form’ %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Go ahead and test out a new post to find nothing has changed on the front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you know how to commit your work with git at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Edit/Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, you’re never going to write a whole post the right way on the first try. Hell, this post probably has so many typos I’m surprised you’re still reading it. Adding update and edit functionality is fairly easy in our Rails app. Here’s the extra code you’ll need in the &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'edit'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root_path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we now need a new view for the editing page. In &lt;code&gt;/posts&lt;/code&gt;, create a new file called &lt;code&gt;edit.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;. We can actually take the same code we have in &lt;code&gt;new.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; and simply copy/paste it - just be sure to change the &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; tag from “New Post” to “Edit Post”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great. We have all this functionality, but there are no links to get to any of them, and who wants to type things into the address bar? In &lt;code&gt;show.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;, somewhere near where we show the date of the post, go ahead and add these couple lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= link_to 'Edit', edit_post_path(@post) %&amp;gt;
| &amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;link_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Delete'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;method: :delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;data: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;confirm: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;You sure?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, we now have all the CRUD features for our blog. Create, read, update, and destroy all the blog posts you’d like. We’re still not quite finished, though, but we’re nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, anyone can come into your application and start deleting your posts - or worse, they can make their own posts. Our application is great and all, but it has no idea who you are. We’re going to fix that right now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/a&gt;. First step for this is to add the gem to our Gemfile. We did this before while adding Bootstrap. Simply append &lt;code&gt;gem &amp;#39;devise&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;~&amp;gt; 3.4.0&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;. Restart your server and run &lt;code&gt;rails g devise:install&lt;/code&gt;. This will prompt some instructions for you. Step five should be to install the Devise views, we’ll do that by running &lt;code&gt;rails g devise:views&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, run &lt;code&gt;rails g devise User&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to &lt;a&gt;localhost:3000/users/sign&lt;em&gt;up&lt;/a&gt; you should be able to sign up. The only thing left to do is still make sure that not just anyone can mess around with your posts. In posts&lt;/em&gt;controller.rb, right on the second line add this line of code provided by Devise, &lt;code&gt;before_action :authentication_user!, except: [:index, :show]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is left is to make sure you have to be signed in to access the edit and delete links. This one’s easy, in &lt;code&gt;show.html.erb&lt;/code&gt;, wrap the edit and delete links in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% if user_signed_in? %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Commit all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Heroku Create&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying your app can be the hardest part. I went through many different attempts to try and get this app running as smooth as I can, since I wasn’t prepared to handle sysadmin stuff at this point in time, I ended up making it a separate little app on Heroku instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku makes things so effortless anyone can have an app running on the live web in a matter of minutes. There are a couple tiny adjustments we have to make in our app first. Heroku and SQLite don’t play nicely together, it prefers Postgresql. In your Gemfile, comment out the sqlite3 gem and at the bottom of the file add this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:production&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'pg'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to commit this, and &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;. There, now your app is ready to run on Heroku’s servers. For the next part, just make a free account over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and follow their instructions for getting the tool belt installed. Once you’ve done that, run &lt;code&gt;heroku create&lt;/code&gt;. If you refresh your dashboard on Heroku you’ll see a new app appear. At this point, you can try running &lt;code&gt;heroku open&lt;/code&gt; which will load your app live in your browser, however, nothing is really there yet except a little note assuring us everything is okay. We still have to run &lt;code&gt;git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt; - this will actually push your app onto the server, it might take a while. Finally, we run a migration through heroku with &lt;code&gt;heroku run rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heroku open and you should see your site live! Share the link with pride. Go back to your dashboard and connect it with the Github repo so when you push changes Heroku can detect them straight from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to get a little hack-y. I’m not sure of the most efficient way to go about this, if I’m doing this totally wrong, well, at least I had a good time. Go to your app users/sign_up and create an account. Don’t forget these credentials and make sure they’re fairly secure. git clone your app again or however you have it set up at the moment and navigate to the &lt;code&gt;app/models/user.rb&lt;/code&gt; file and just remove the &lt;code&gt;:registerable&lt;/code&gt; tag. This will allow no one to make an account on your blog and start messing with your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit it, deploy the latest branch in the Heroku dashboard, and you should be fully set to go.&lt;/p&gt;
